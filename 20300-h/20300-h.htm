<h2>PREFACE.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagev" name="pagev"></a>(p. v)</span></h2>


<p>It is perhaps a matter rather for regret than for surprise that so few
attempts have been made to describe, as a whole, the life and
character of Henry VIII. No ruler has left a deeper impress on the
history of his country, or done work which has been the subject of
more keen and lasting contention. Courts of law are still debating the
intention of statutes, the tenor of which he dictated; and the moral,
political, and religious, are as much in dispute as the legal, results
of his reign. He is still the Great Erastian, the protagonist of laity
against clergy. His policy is inextricably interwoven with the high
and eternal dilemma of Church and State; and it is well-nigh
impossible for one who feels keenly on these questions to treat the
reign of Henry VIII. in a reasonably judicial spirit. No period
illustrates more vividly the contradiction between morals and
politics. In our desire to reprobate the immorality of Henry's
methods, we are led to deny their success; or, in our appreciation of
the greatness of the ends he achieved, we seek to excuse the means he
took to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevi" name="pagevi"></a>(p. vi)</span>
achieve them. As with his policy, so with his
character. There was nothing commonplace about him; his good and his
bad qualities alike were exceptional. It is easy, by suppressing the
one or the other, to paint him a hero or a villain. He lends himself
readily to polemic; but to depict his character in all its varied
aspects, extenuating nothing nor setting down aught in malice, is a
task of no little difficulty. It is two centuries and a half since
Lord Herbert produced his <i>Life and Reign of Henry
VIII</i>.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>
 The late
Mr. Brewer, in his prefaces to the first four volumes of the <i>Letters
and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII.</i>, published under the direction
of the Master of the Rolls, dealt adequately with the earlier portion
of Henry's career. But Mr. Brewer died when his work reached the year
1530; his successor, Dr. James Gairdner, was directed to confine his
prefaces to the later volumes within the narrowest possible limits;
and students of history were deprived of the prospect of a
satisfactory account of Henry's later years from a writer of
unrivalled learning.</p>

<p>Henry's reign, from 1530 onwards, has been described by the late Mr.
Froude in one of the most brilliant and fascinating masterpieces of
historical literature, a work which still holds the field in popular,
if not in scholarly, estimation. But Mr. Froude does not begin until
Henry's reign was half over, until his character had been determined
by influences
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevii" name="pagevii"></a>(p. vii)</span>
and events which lie outside the scope of Mr.
Froude's inquiry. Moreover, since Mr. Froude wrote, a flood of light
has been thrown on the period by the publication of the
above-mentioned <i>Letters and
Papers</i>;<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2">[2]</a>
they already comprise a
summary of between thirty and forty thousand documents in twenty
thousand closely printed pages, and, when completed, will constitute
the most magnificent body of materials for the history of any reign,
ancient or modern, English or foreign. Simultaneously there have
appeared a dozen volumes containing the State papers preserved at
Simancas,<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3">[3]</a>
Vienna and Brussels and similar series comprising the
correspondence relating to Venice,<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4">[4]</a>
Scotland<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5">[5]</a>
and Ireland;<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6">[6]</a>
while the despatches of French ambassadors have been published under
the auspices of the Ministry for Foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageviii" name="pageviii"></a>(p. viii)</span>
Affairs at
Paris.<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7">[7]</a>
Still further information has been provided by the labours
of the Historical Manuscripts
Commission,<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8">[8]</a>
the Camden,<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9">[9]</a>
the Royal
Historical,<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10">[10]</a>
and other learned Societies.</p>

<p>These sources probably contain at least a million definite facts
relating to the reign of Henry VIII.; and it is obvious that the task
of selection has become heavy as well as invidious. Mr. Froude has
expressed his concurrence in the dictum that the facts of history are
like the letters of the alphabet; by selection and arrangement they
can be made to spell anything, and nothing can be arranged so easily
as facts. <i>Experto crede</i>. Yet selection is inevitable, and
arrangement essential. The historian has no option if he wishes to be
intelligible. He will naturally arrange his facts so that they spell
what he believes to be the truth; and he must of necessity suppress
those facts which he judges to be immaterial or inconsistent with the
scale on which he is writing. But if the superabundance of facts
compels both selection and suppression, it counsels no less a
restraint of judgment. A case in a court of law is not simplified by a
cloud of witnesses; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageix" name="pageix"></a>(p. ix)</span>
new wealth of contemporary
evidence does not solve the problems of Henry's reign. It elucidates
some points hitherto obscure, but it raises a host of others never
before suggested. In ancient history we often accept statements
written hundreds of years after the event, simply because we know no
better; in modern history we frequently have half a dozen witnesses
giving inconsistent accounts of what they have seen with their own
eyes. Dogmatism is merely the result of ignorance; and no honest
historian will pretend to have mastered all the facts, accurately
weighed all the evidence, or pronounced a final judgment.</p>

<p>The present volume does not profess to do more than roughly sketch
Henry VIII.'s more prominent characteristics, outline the chief
features of his policy, and suggest some reasons for the measure of
success he attained. Episodes such as the divorce of Catherine of
Aragon, the dissolution of the monasteries, and the determination of
the relations between Church and State, would severally demand for
adequate treatment works of much greater bulk than the present. On the
divorce valuable light has recently been thrown by Dr. Stephan Ehses
in his <i>Römische
Dokumente</i>.<a id="footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11">[11]</a>
The dissolution of the monasteries
has been exhaustively treated from one point of view by Dr.
Gasquet;<a id="footnotetag12" name="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12">[12]</a>
but an adequate and impartial history of what is called
the Reformation still
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagex" name="pagex"></a>(p. x)</span>
remains to be written. Here it is
possible to deal with these questions only in the briefest outline,
and in so far as they were affected by Henry's personal action. For my
facts I have relied entirely on contemporary records, and my
deductions from these facts are my own. I have depended as little as
possible even on contemporary historians,<a id="footnotetag13" name="footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13">[13]</a>
and scarcely at all on
later writers.<a id="footnotetag14" name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14">[14]</a>
I have, however, made frequent use of Dr.
Gairdner's articles in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>,
particularly of that on Henry VIII., the best summary extant of his
career; and I owe not a little to Bishop Stubbs's two lectures on
Henry VIII., which contain some fruitful suggestions as to his
character.<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15">[15]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page001" name="page001"></a>(p. 001)</span></h3>

<h4>THE EARLY TUDORS.</h4>


<p>In the whole range of English history there is no monarch whose
character has been more variously depicted by contemporaries or more
strenuously debated by posterity than the "majestic lord who broke the
bonds of Rome". To one historian an inhuman embodiment of cruelty and
vice, to another a superhuman incarnation of courage, wisdom and
strength of will, Henry VIII. has, by an almost universal consent,
been placed above or below the grade of humanity. So unique was his
personality, so singular his achievements, that he appears in the
light of a special dispensation sent like another Attila to be the
scourge of mankind, or like a second Hercules to cleanse, or at least
to demolish, Augean stables. The dictates of his will seemed as
inexorable as the decrees of fate, and the history of his reign is
strewn with records of the ruin of those who failed to placate his
wrath. Of the six queens he married, two he divorced, and two he
beheaded. Four English cardinals<a id="footnotetag16" name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16">[16]</a>
lived in his reign; one perished
by the executioner's axe, one escaped it by absence, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page002" name="page002"></a>(p. 002)</span>
third by a timely but natural death. Of a similar number of
dukes<a id="footnotetag17" name="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17">[17]</a>
half were condemned by attainder; and the same method of speedy
despatch accounted for six or seven earls and viscounts and for scores
of lesser degree. He began his reign by executing the ministers of his
father,<a id="footnotetag18" name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18">[18]</a>
he continued it by sending his own to the scaffold. The
Tower of London was both palace and prison, and statesmen passed
swiftly from one to the other; in silent obscurity alone lay
salvation. Religion and politics, rank and profession made little
difference; priest and layman, cardinal-archbishop and "hammer of the
monks," men whom Henry had raised from the mire, and peers, over whose
heads they were placed, were joined in a common fate. Wolsey and More,
Cromwell and Norfolk, trod the same dizzy path to the same fatal end;
and the English people looked on powerless or unmoved. They sent their
burgesses and knights of the shire to Westminster without let or
hindrance, and Parliament met with a regularity that grew with the
rigour of Henry's rule; but it seemed to assemble only to register the
royal edicts and clothe with a legal cloak the naked violence of
Henry's acts. It remembered its privileges only to lay them at Henry's
feet, it cancelled his debts, endowed his proclamations with the force
of laws, and authorised him to repeal acts of attainder and dispose of
his crown at will. Secure of its support Henry turned and rent the
spiritual unity of Western Christendom, and settled at a blow that
perennial struggle between Church and State,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page003" name="page003"></a>(p. 003)</span>
in which kings
and emperors had bitten the dust. With every epithet of contumely and
scorn he trampled under foot the jurisdiction of him who was believed
to hold the keys of heaven and hell. Borrowing in practice the old
maxim of Roman law, <i>cujus regio, ejus
religio</i>,<a id="footnotetag19" name="footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19">[19]</a>
he placed himself
in the seat of authority in religion and presumed to define the faith
of which Leo had styled him defender. Others have made themselves
despots by their mastery of many legions, through the agency of a
secret police, or by means of an organised bureaucracy. Yet Henry's
standing army consisted of a few gentlemen pensioners and yeomen of
the guard; he had neither secret police nor organised bureaucracy.
Even then Englishmen boasted that they were not slaves like the
French,<a id="footnotetag20" name="footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20">[20]</a>
and foreigners pointed a finger of scorn at their
turbulence. Had they not permanently or temporarily deprived of power
nearly half their kings who had reigned since William the Conqueror?
Yet Henry VIII. not only left them their arms, but repeatedly urged
them to keep those arms ready for
use.<a id="footnotetag21" name="footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21">[21]</a>
He eschewed that air of
mystery with which tyrants have usually sought to impose on the mind
of the people. All his life he moved familiarly and almost unguarded
in the midst of his subjects, and he died in his bed, full of years,
with the spell of his power unbroken and the terror of his name
unimpaired.</p>

<p>What manner of man was this, and wherein lay the secret
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page004" name="page004"></a>(p. 004)</span>
of
his strength? Is recourse necessary to a theory of supernatural
agency, or is there another and adequate solution? Was Henry's
individual will of such miraculous force that he could ride roughshod
in insolent pride over public opinion at home and abroad? Or did his
personal ends, dictated perhaps by selfish motives and ignoble
passions, so far coincide with the interests and prejudices of the
politically effective portion of his people, that they were willing to
condone a violence and tyranny, the brunt of which fell after all on
the few? Such is the riddle which propounds itself to every student of
Tudor history. It cannot be answered by pæans in honour of Henry's
intensity of will and force of character, nor by invectives against
his vices and lamentations over the woes of his victims. The
miraculous interpretation of history is as obsolete as the
catastrophic theory of geology, and the explanation of Henry's career
must be sought not so much in the study of his character as in the
study of his environment, of the conditions which made things possible
to him that were not possible before or since and are not likely to be
so again.</p>

<p class="p2"></p>

<p>It is a singular circumstance that the king who raised the personal
power of English monarchy to a height to which it had never before
attained, should have come of humble race and belonged to an upstart
dynasty. For three centuries and a half before the battle of Bosworth
one family had occupied the English throne. Even the usurpers, Henry
of Bolingbroke and Richard of York, were directly descended in
unbroken male line from Henry II., and from 1154 to 1485 all the
sovereigns of England were Plantagenets. But who were the Tudors?
They
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page005" name="page005"></a>(p. 005)</span>
were a Welsh family of modest means and doubtful
antecedents.<a id="footnotetag22" name="footnotetag22"></a><a href="#footnote22">[22]</a>
They claimed, it is true, descent from Cadwallader,
and their pedigree was as long and quite as veracious as most Welsh
genealogies; but Henry VII.'s great-grandfather was steward or butler
to the Bishop of Bangor. His son, Owen Tudor, came as a young man to
seek his fortune at the Court of Henry V., and obtained a clerkship of
the wardrobe to Henry's Queen, Catherine of France. So skilfully did
he use or abuse this position of trust, that he won the heart of his
mistress; and within a few years of Henry's death his widowed Queen
and her clerk of the wardrobe were secretly, and possibly without
legal sanction, living together as man and wife. The discovery of
their relations resulted in Catherine's retirement to Bermondsey
Abbey, and Owen's to Newgate prison. The Queen died in the following
year, but Owen survived many romantic adventures. Twice he escaped
from prison, twice he was recaptured. Once he took sanctuary in the
precincts of Westminster Abbey, and various attempts to entrap him
were made by enticing him to revels in a neighbouring tavern. Finally,
on the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses, he espoused the Lancastrian
cause, and was beheaded by order of Edward IV. after the battle of
Mortimer's Cross. Two sons, Edmund and Jasper, were born of this
singular match between Queen and clerk of her wardrobe. Both enjoyed
the favour of their royal half-brother, Henry VI. Edmund, the elder,
was first knighted and then created Earl of Richmond. In the
Parliament of 1453, he was formally declared legitimate; he was
enriched by the grant of broad estates and enrolled among the members
of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page006" name="page006"></a>(p. 006)</span>
Henry's council. But the climax of his fortunes was
reached when, in 1455, he married the Lady Margaret Beaufort. Owen
Tudor had taken the first step which led to his family's greatness;
Edmund took the second. The blood-royal of France flowed in his veins,
the blood-royal of England was to flow in his children's; and the
union between Edmund Tudor and Margaret Beaufort gave Henry VII. such
claim as he had by descent to the English throne.</p>

<p>The Beauforts were descended from Edward III., but a bar sinister
marred their royal pedigree. John of Gaunt had three sons by Catherine
Swynford before she became his wife. That marriage would, by canon
law, have made legitimate the children, but the barons had, on a
famous occasion, refused to assimilate in this respect the laws of
England to the canons of the Church; and it required a special Act of
Parliament to confer on the Beauforts the status of legitimacy. When
Henry IV. confirmed this Act, he introduced a clause specifically
barring their contingent claim to the English throne. This limitation
could not legally abate the force of a statute; but it sufficed to
cast a doubt upon the Beaufort title, and has been considered a
sufficient explanation of Henry VII.'s reluctance to base his claim
upon hereditary right. However that may be, the Beauforts played no
little part in the English history of the fifteenth century; their
influence was potent for peace or war in the councils of their royal
half-brother, Henry IV., and of the later sovereigns of the House of
Lancaster. One was Cardinal-Bishop of Winchester, another was Duke of
Exeter, and a third was Earl of Somerset. Two of the sons of the Earl
became Dukes of Somerset; the younger fell at St. Albans,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page007" name="page007"></a>(p. 007)</span>
the earliest victim of the Wars of the Roses, which proved so fatal to
his House; and the male line of the Beauforts failed in the third
generation. The sole heir to their claims was the daughter of the
first Duke of Somerset, Margaret, now widow of Edmund Tudor; for,
after a year of wedded life, Edmund had died in November, 1456. Two
months later his widow gave birth to a boy, the future Henry VII.;
and, incredible as the fact may seem, the youthful mother was not
quite fourteen years old. When fifteen more years had passed, the
murder of Henry VI. and his son left Margaret Beaufort and Henry Tudor
in undisputed possession of the Lancastrian title. A barren honour it
seemed. Edward IV. was firmly seated on the English throne. His right
to it, by every test, was immeasurably superior to the Tudor claim,
and Henry showed no inclination and possessed not the means to dispute
it. The usurpation by Richard III., and the crimes which polluted his
reign, put a different aspect on the situation, and set men seeking
for an alternative to the blood-stained tyrant. The battle of Bosworth
followed, and the last of the Plantagenets gave way to the first of
the Tudors.</p>

<p>For the first time, since the Norman Conquest, a king of decisively
British blood sat on the English throne. His lineage was, indeed,
English in only a minor degree; but England might seem to have lost at
the battle of Hastings her right to native kings; and Norman were
succeeded by Angevin, Angevin by Welsh, Welsh by Scots, and Scots by
Hanoverian sovereigns. The Tudors were probably more at home on the
English throne than most of England's kings; and their humble and
British origin may have contributed to their unique capacity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page008" name="page008"></a>(p. 008)</span>
for understanding the needs, and expressing the mind, of the English
nation. It was well for them that they established their throne in the
hearts of their people, for no dynasty grasped the sceptre with less
of hereditary right. Judged by that criterion, there were many
claimants whose titles must have been preferred to Henry's. There were
the daughters of Edward IV. and the children of George, Duke of
Clarence; and their existence may account for Henry's neglect to press
his hereditary claim. But there was a still better reason. Supposing
the Lancastrian case to be valid and the Beauforts to be the true
Lancastrian heirs, even so the rightful occupant of the throne was not
Henry VII., but his mother, Margaret Beaufort. England had never
recognised a Salic law at home; on occasion she had disputed its
validity abroad. But Henry VII. was not disposed to let his mother
rule; she could not unite the Yorkist and Lancastrian claims by
marriage, and, in addition to other disabilities, she had a second
husband in Lord Stanley, who might demand the crown matrimonial. So
Henry VII.'s hereditary title was judiciously veiled in vague
obscurity. Parliament wisely admitted the accomplished fact and
recognised that the crown was vested in him, without rashly venturing
upon the why or the wherefore. He had in truth been raised to the
throne because men were weary of Richard. He was chosen to vindicate
no theory of hereditary or other abstract right, but to govern with a
firm hand, to establish peace within his gates and give prosperity to
his people. That was the true Tudor title, and, as a rule, they
remembered the fact; they were <i>de facto</i> kings, and they left the <i>de
jure</i> arguments to the Stuarts.</p>

<p>Peace,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009"></a>(p. 009)</span>
however, could not be obtained at once, nor the embers
of thirty years' strife stamped out in a moment. For fifteen years
open revolt and whispered sedition troubled the rest of the realm and
threatened the stability of Henry's throne. Ireland remained a hot-bed
of Yorkist sympathies, and Ireland was zealously aided by Edward IV.'s
sister, Margaret of Burgundy; she pursued, like a vendetta, the family
quarrel with Henry VII., and earned the title of Henry's Juno by
harassing him as vindictively as the Queen of Heaven vexed the pious
Æneas. Other rulers, with no Yorkist bias, were slow to recognise the
<i>parvenu</i> king and quick to profit by his difficulties. Pretenders to
their rivals' thrones were useful pawns on the royal chess-board; and
though the princes of Europe had no reason to desire a Yorkist
restoration, they thought that a little judicious backing of Yorkist
claimants would be amply repaid by the restriction of Henry's energies
to domestic affairs. Seven months after the battle of Bosworth there
was a rising in the West under the Staffords, and in the North under
Lovell; and Henry himself was nearly captured while celebrating at
York the feast of St. George. A year later a youth of obscure origin,
Lambert Simnel,<a id="footnotetag23" name="footnotetag23"></a><a href="#footnote23">[23]</a>
claimed to be first the Duke of York and then the
Earl of Warwick. The former was son, and the latter was nephew, of
Edward IV. Lambert was crowned king at Dublin amid the acclamations of
the Irish people. Not a voice was raised in Henry's favour; Kildare,
the practical ruler of Ireland, earls and archbishops, bishops and
barons, and great officers of State, from Lord Chancellor downwards,
swore fealty to the reputed son of an Oxford tradesman. Ireland was
only
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010"></a>(p. 010)</span>
the volcano which gave vent to the subterranean flood;
treason in England and intrigue abroad were working in secret concert
with open rebellion across St. George's Channel. The Queen Dowager was
secluded in Bermondsey Abbey and deprived of her jointure lands. John
de la Pole, who, as eldest son of Edward IV.'s sister, had been named
his successor by Richard III., fled to Burgundy; thence his aunt
Margaret sent Martin Schwartz and two thousand mercenaries to
co-operate with the Irish invasion. But, at East Stoke, De la Pole and
Lovell, Martin Schwartz and his merry men were slain; and the most
serious of the revolts against Henry ended in the consignment of
Simnel to the royal scullery and of his tutor to the Tower.</p>

<p>Lambert, however, was barely initiated in his new duties when the son
of a boatman of Tournay started on a similar errand with a less
congenial end. An unwilling puppet at first, Perkin Warbeck was on a
trading visit to Ireland, when the Irish, who saw a Yorkist prince in
every likely face, insisted that Perkin was Earl of Warwick. This he
denied on oath before the Mayor of Cork. Nothing deterred, they
suggested that he was Richard III.'s bastard; but the bastard was safe
in Henry's keeping, and the imaginative Irish finally took refuge in
the theory that Perkin was Duke of York. Lambert's old friends rallied
round Perkin; the re-animated Duke was promptly summoned to the Court
of France and treated with princely honours. When Charles VIII. had
used him to beat down Henry's terms, Perkin found a home with
Margaret, aunt to all the pretenders. As usual, there were traitors in
high places in England. Sir William Stanley, whose brother had married
Henry's mother,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page011" name="page011"></a>(p. 011)</span>
and to whom Henry himself owed his victory
at Bosworth, was implicated. His sudden arrest disconcerted the plot,
and when Perkin's fleet appeared off the coast of Kent, the rustics
made short work of the few who were rash enough to land. Perkin sailed
away to the Yorkist refuge in Ireland, but Kildare was no longer
deputy. Waterford, to which he laid siege, was relieved, and the
pretender sought in Scotland a third basis of operations. An abortive
raid on the Borders and a high-born Scottish wife<a id="footnotetag24" name="footnotetag24"></a><a href="#footnote24">[24]</a>
were all that he
obtained of James IV., and in 1497, after a second attempt in Ireland,
he landed in Cornwall. The Cornishmen had just risen against Henry's
extortions, marched on London and been defeated at Blackheath; but
Henry's lenience encouraged a fresh revolt, and three thousand men
flocked to Perkin's standard. They failed to take Exeter; Perkin was
seized at Beaulieu and sent up to London to be paraded through the
streets amid the jeers and taunts of the people. Two years later a
foolish attempt at escape and a fresh personation of the Earl of
Warwick by one Ralf
Wulford<a id="footnotetag25" name="footnotetag25"></a><a href="#footnote25">[25]</a>
led to the execution of all three,
Perkin, Wulford, and the real Earl of Warwick, who had been a prisoner
and probably the innocent centre of so many plots since the accession
of Henry VII. Warwick's death may have been due to the instigation of
Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, who were negotiating for the marriage
of Catherine of Aragon with Prince Arthur. They were naturally anxious
for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page012" name="page012"></a>(p. 012)</span>
security of the throne their daughter was to share
with Henry's son; and now their ambassador wrote triumphantly that
there remained in England not a doubtful drop of royal
blood.<a id="footnotetag26" name="footnotetag26"></a><a href="#footnote26">[26]</a>
There were no more pretenders, and for the rest of Henry's reign
England enjoyed such peace as it had not known for nearly a century.
The end which Henry had sought by fair means and foul was attained,
and there was no practical alternative to his children in the
succession to the English throne.</p>

<p>But all his statecraft, his patience and labour would have been writ
in water without children to succeed him and carry on the work which
he had begun; and at times it seemed probable that this necessary
condition would remain unfulfilled. For the Tudors were singularly
luckless in the matter of children. They were scarcely a sterile race,
but their offspring had an unfortunate habit of dying in childhood. It
was the desire for a male heir that involved Henry VIII. in his breach
with Rome, and led Mary into a marriage which raised a revolt; the
last of the Tudors perceived that heirs might be purchased at too
great a cost, and solved the difficulty by admitting its insolubility.
Henry VIII. had six wives, but only three children who survived
infancy; of these, Edward VI. withered away at the age of fifteen, and
Mary died childless at forty-two. By his
two<a id="footnotetag27" name="footnotetag27"></a><a href="#footnote27">[27]</a>
mistresses he seems
to have had only one son, who died at the age of eleven, and as far as
we know, he had not a single grandchild, legitimate or other. His
sisters were hardly more fortunate. Margaret's eldest son by James IV.
died a year after his birth; her eldest daughter died at birth; her
second
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page013" name="page013"></a>(p. 013)</span>
son lived only nine months; her second daughter died
at birth; her third son lived to be James V., but her fourth found an
early grave. Mary, the other sister of Henry VIII., lost her only son
in his teens. The appalling death-rate among Tudor infants cannot be
attributed solely to medical ignorance, for Yorkist babies clung to
life with a tenacity which was quite as inconvenient as the readiness
with which Tudor infants relinquished it; and Richard III., Henry VII.
and Henry VIII. all found it necessary to accelerate, by artificial
means, the exit from the world of the superfluous children of other
pretenders. This drastic process smoothed their path, but could not
completely solve the problem; and the characteristic Tudor infirmity
was already apparent in the reign of Henry VII. He had three sons; two
predeceased him, one at the age of fifteen years, the other at fifteen
months. Of his four daughters, two died in infancy, and the youngest
cost the mother her
life.<a id="footnotetag28" name="footnotetag28"></a><a href="#footnote28">[28]</a>
The fruit of that union between the Red
Rose and the White, upon which so much store had been
set,<a id="footnotetag29" name="footnotetag29"></a><a href="#footnote29">[29]</a>
seemed
doomed to fail.</p>

<p>The hopes built upon it had largely contributed to the success of
Henry's raid upon the English throne, and before he started on his
quest he had solemnly promised to marry Elizabeth, eldest daughter of
Edward IV., and heiress of the House of York. But he was resolute to
avoid all appearance of ruling in her right; his title had been
recognised by Parliament, and he had been five months <i>de facto</i> king
before he wedded his Yorkist wife (18th January, 1486). Eight months
and two days later, the Queen gave birth, in the priory of St.
Swithin's, at Winchester,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page014" name="page014"></a>(p. 014)</span>
to her first-born son. Four days
later, on Sunday, 24th September, the child was christened in the
minster of the old West Saxon capital, and given in baptism the name
of Arthur, the old British king. It was neither Yorkist nor
Lancastrian, it evoked no bitter memories of civil strife, and it
recalled the fact that the Tudors claimed a pedigree and boasted a
title to British sovereignty, beside the antiquity of which Yorkist
pretentions were a mushroom growth. Duke of Cornwall from his birth,
Prince Arthur was, when three years old, created Prince of Wales.
Already negotiations had been begun for his marriage with Catherine,
the daughter of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile. Both were
cautious sovereigns, and many a rebellion had to be put down and many
a pretender put away, before they would consent to entrust their
daughter to the care of an English king. It was not till 2nd October,
1501, that Catherine landed at Plymouth. At her formal reception into
England, and at her marriage, six weeks later, in St. Paul's, she was
led by the hand of her little brother-in-law, Prince Henry, then ten
years old.<a id="footnotetag30" name="footnotetag30"></a><a href="#footnote30">[30]</a>
Against the advice of his council, Henry VII. sent the
youthful bride and bridegroom to live as man and wife at Ludlow
Castle, and there, five and a half months later, their married life
came to a sudden end. Prince Arthur died on 2nd April, 1502, and was
buried in princely state in Worcester Cathedral.</p>





<h3>CHAPTER II.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page015" name="page015"></a>(p. 015)</span></h3>

<h4>PRINCE HENRY AND HIS ENVIRONMENT.</h4>


<p>The Prince, who now succeeded to the position of heir-apparent, was
nearly five years younger than his brother. The third child and second
son of his parents, he was born on 28th June, 1491, at Greenwich, a
palace henceforth intimately associated with the history of Tudor
sovereigns. The manor of Greenwich had belonged to the alien priory of
Lewisham, and, on the dissolution of those houses, had passed into the
hands of Henry IV. Then it was granted to Humphrey, Duke of
Gloucester, who began to enclose the palace grounds; on his death it
reverted to the Crown; and Edward IV., many of whose tastes and
characteristics were inherited by his grandson, Henry VIII., took
great delight in beautifying and extending the palace. He gave it to
his Queen, Elizabeth, and in her possession it remained until her
sympathy with Yorkist plots was punished by the forfeiture of her
lands. Henry VII. then bestowed it on his wife, the dowager's
daughter, and thus it became the birthplace of her younger children.
Here was the scene of many a joust and tournament, of many a masque
and revel; here the young Henry, as soon as he came to the throne, was
wedded to Catherine of Aragon; here Henry's sister was married to the
Duke of Suffolk; and here were born all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page016" name="page016"></a>(p. 016)</span>
future Tudor
sovereigns, Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth. At Greenwich, then,
through the forfeit of his grandmother, Henry was born; he was
baptised in the Church of the Observant Friars, an Order, the object
first of his special
favour,<a id="footnotetag31" name="footnotetag31"></a><a href="#footnote31">[31]</a>
and then of an equally marked
dislike; the ceremony was performed by Richard
Fox,<a id="footnotetag32" name="footnotetag32"></a><a href="#footnote32">[32]</a>
then Bishop of
Exeter, and afterwards one of the child's chief advisers. His nurse
was named Ann Luke, and years afterwards, when Henry was King, he
allowed her the annual pension of twenty pounds, equivalent to about
three hundred in modern currency. The details of his early life are
few and far between. Lord Herbert, who wrote his <i>Life and Reign</i> a
century later, records that the young Prince was destined by his
father for the see of
Canterbury,<a id="footnotetag33" name="footnotetag33"></a><a href="#footnote33">[33]</a>
and provided with an education
more suited to a clerical than to a lay career. The motive ascribed to
Henry VII. is typical of his character; it was more economical to
provide for younger sons out of ecclesiastical, than royal, revenues.
But the story is probably a mere inference from the excellence of the
boy's education, and from his father's thrift. If the idea of an
ecclesiastical career for young Henry was ever entertained, it was
soon abandoned for secular preferment. On 5th April, 1492, before the
child was ten months old, he was appointed to the ancient and
important posts of Warden of the Cinque Ports and Constable of Dover
Castle.<a id="footnotetag34" name="footnotetag34"></a><a href="#footnote34">[34]</a>
A little later he received the still more honourable
office of Earl Marshal; the duties were performed by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page017" name="page017"></a>(p. 017)</span>
deputy,
but a goodly portion of the fees was doubtless appropriated for the
expenses of the boy's establishment, or found its way into the royal
coffers. Further promotion awaited him at the mature age of three. On
12th September, 1494, he became Lord-Lieutenant of
Ireland;<a id="footnotetag35" name="footnotetag35"></a><a href="#footnote35">[35]</a>
six
weeks later he was created Duke of York, and dubbed, with the usual
quaint and formal
ceremonies,<a id="footnotetag36" name="footnotetag36"></a><a href="#footnote36">[36]</a>
a Knight of the Bath. In December,
he was made Warden of the Scottish Marches, and he was invested with
the Garter in the following
May.<a id="footnotetag37" name="footnotetag37"></a><a href="#footnote37">[37]</a></p>

<p>The accumulation of these great offices of State, any one of which
might have taxed the powers of a tried administrator, in the feeble
hands of a child appears at first sight a trifle irrational; but there
was always method in Henry's madness. In bestowing these
administrative posts upon his children he was really concentrating
them in his own person and bringing them directly under his own
supervision. It was the policy whereby the early Roman Emperors
imposed upon Republican Rome the substance, without the form, of
despotism. It limited the powers of mischief which Henry's nobles
might otherwise have enjoyed, and provided incomes for his children
without increasing taxation or diminishing the privy purse. The work
of administration could be done at least as effectively, much more
economically, and with far less danger to internal peace by deputies
of lower rank than the dukes and earls and barons who had been wont to
abuse these high positions for the furtherance of private ends, and
often for the levying
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page018" name="page018"></a>(p. 018)</span>
of private war. Nowhere were the
advantages of Henry's policy more conspicuous than in his arrangements
for the government of Ireland. Ever since Richard, Duke of York, and
George, Duke of Clarence, had ruled as Irish viceroys, Ireland had
been a Yorkist stronghold. There Simnel had been crowned king, and
there peers and peasants had fought for Perkin Warbeck. Something must
be done to heal the running sore. Possibly Henry thought that some of
Ireland's loyalty might be diverted from Yorkist channels by the
selection of a Tudor prince as its viceroy; but he put his trust in
more solid measures. As deputy to his infant son he nominated one who,
though but a knight, was perhaps the ablest man among his privy
council. It was in this capacity that Sir Edward
Poynings<a id="footnotetag38" name="footnotetag38"></a><a href="#footnote38">[38]</a>
crossed
to Ireland about the close of 1494, and called the Parliament of
Drogheda. Judged by the durability of its legislation, it was one of
the most memorable of parliaments; and for nearly three hundred years
Poynings' laws remained the foundation upon which rested the
constitutional relations between the sister kingdoms. Even more
lasting was the precedent set by Prince Henry's creation as Duke of
York; from that day to this, from Henry VIII. to the present Prince of
Wales, the second son of the sovereign or of the heir-apparent has
almost invariably been invested with that
dukedom.<a id="footnotetag39" name="footnotetag39"></a><a href="#footnote39">[39]</a>
The original
selection of the title was due to substantial reasons. Henry's name
was distinctively Lancastrian, his title was no less distinctively
Yorkist;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page019" name="page019"></a>(p. 019)</span>
it was adopted as a concession to Yorkist
prejudice. It was a practical reminder of the fact which the Tudor
laureate, Skelton, celebrated in song: "The rose both red and white,
in one rose now doth grow". It was also a tacit assertion of the death
of the last Duke of York in the Tower and of the imposture of Perkin
Warbeck, now pretending to the title.</p>

<p>But thoughts of the coercion of Ireland and conciliation of Yorkists
were as yet far from the mind of the child, round whose person these
measures were made to centre. Precocious he must have been, if the
phenomenal development of brow and the curiously mature expression
attributed to him in his
portrait<a id="footnotetag40" name="footnotetag40"></a><a href="#footnote40">[40]</a>
are any indication of his
intellectual powers at the age at which he is represented. Without the
childish lips and nose, the face might well be that of a man of fifty;
and with the addition of a beard, the portrait would be an
unmistakable likeness of Henry himself in his later years. When the
Prince was no more than a child, says Erasmus, he was set to
study.<a id="footnotetag41" name="footnotetag41"></a><a href="#footnote41">[41]</a>
He had, we are told, a vivid and active mind, above measure
able to execute whatever tasks he undertook; and he never attempted
anything in which he did not
succeed.<a id="footnotetag42" name="footnotetag42"></a><a href="#footnote42">[42]</a>
The Tudors had no modern
dread of educational over-pressure when applied to their children, and
the young Henry was probably as forward a pupil as his son, Edward
VI., his daughter, Elizabeth, or his grand-niece, Lady Jane Grey. But,
fortunately for Henry,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page020" name="page020"></a>(p. 020)</span>
a physical exuberance corrected his
mental precocity; and, as he grew older, any excessive devotion to the
Muses was checked by an unwearied pursuit of bodily culture. He was
the first of English sovereigns to be educated under the new influence
of the Renaissance. Scholars, divines and poets thronged the Court of
Henry VII. Margaret Beaufort, who ruled in Henry's household, was a
signal benefactor to the cause of English learning. Lady Margaret
professors commemorate her name in both our ancient universities, and
in their bidding prayers she is to this day remembered. Two colleges
at Cambridge revere her as their foundress; Caxton, the greatest of
English printers, owed much to her munificence, and she herself
translated into English books from both Latin and French. Henry VII.,
though less accomplished that the later Tudors, evinced an intelligent
interest in art and letters, and provided for his children efficient
instructors; while his Queen, Elizabeth of York, is described by
Erasmus as possessing the soundest judgment and as being remarkable
for her prudence as well as for her piety. Bernard
André,<a id="footnotetag43" name="footnotetag43"></a><a href="#footnote43">[43]</a>
historian and poet, who had been tutor to Prince Arthur, probably took
no small part in the education of his younger brother; to him he
dedicated, after Arthur's death, two of the annual summaries of events
which he was in the habit of compiling. Giles
D'Ewes,<a id="footnotetag44" name="footnotetag44"></a><a href="#footnote44">[44]</a>
apparently a
Frenchman and the author of a notable French
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page021" name="page021"></a>(p. 021)</span>
grammar, taught
that language to Prince Henry, as many years later he did to his
daughter, Queen Mary; probably either D'Ewes or André trained his
handwriting, which is a curious compromise between the clear and bold
Italian style, soon to be adopted by well-instructed Englishmen, and
the old English hieroglyphics in which more humbly educated
individuals, including Shakespeare, concealed the meaning of their
words. But the most famous of Henry's teachers was the poet Skelton,
the greatest name in English verse from Lydgate down to Surrey.
Skelton was poet laureate to Henry VII. Court, and refers in his poems
to his wearing of the white and green of Tudor
liveries.<a id="footnotetag45" name="footnotetag45"></a><a href="#footnote45">[45]</a>
He celebrated in verse Arthur's creation as Prince of Wales and Henry's
as Duke of
York;<a id="footnotetag46" name="footnotetag46"></a><a href="#footnote46">[46]</a>
and before the younger prince was nine years old,
this "incomparable light and ornament of British Letters," as Erasmus
styles him, was directing Henry's studies. Skelton himself writes.&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
The honor of England I learned to spell,<br>
I gave him drink of the sugred well<br>
Of Helicon's waters crystalline,<br>
Acquainting him with the Muses nine.<br>
</p>

<p>The coarseness of Skelton's satires and his open disregard of the
clerical vows of chastity may justify some doubt of the value of the
poet's influence on Henry's character; but he so far observed the
conventional duties of his post as to dedicate to his royal pupil, in
1501, a moral treatise in Latin of no particular
worth.<a id="footnotetag47" name="footnotetag47"></a><a href="#footnote47">[47]</a>
More deserving
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page022" name="page022"></a>(p. 022)</span>
of Henry's study were two books inscribed to him a
little later by young Boerio, son of the King's Genoese physician and
a pupil of Erasmus, who, according to his own account, suffered untold
afflictions from the father's temper. One was a translation of
Isocrates' <i>De Regno</i>, the other of Lucian's tract against believing
calumnies.<a id="footnotetag48" name="footnotetag48"></a><a href="#footnote48">[48]</a>
The latter was, to judge from the tale of Henry's
victims, a precept which he scarcely laid to heart in youth. In other
respects he was apt enough to learn. He showed "remarkable docility
for mathematics," became proficient in Latin, spoke French with ease,
understood Italian, and, later on, possibly from Catherine of Aragon,
acquired a knowledge of Spanish. In 1499 Erasmus himself, the greatest
of the humanists, visited his friend, Lord Mountjoy, near Greenwich,
and made young Henry's acquaintance. "I was staying," he
writes,<a id="footnotetag49" name="footnotetag49"></a><a href="#footnote49">[49]</a>
"at Lord Mountjoy's country house when Thomas More came to see me, and
took me out with him for a walk as far as the next village, where all
the King's children, except Prince Arthur, who was then the eldest
son, were being educated. When we came into the hall, the attendants
not only of the palace, but also of Mountjoy's household, were all
assembled. In the midst stood Prince Henry, now nine years old, and
having already something of royalty in his demeanour in which there
was a certain dignity combined with singular courtesy. On his right
was Margaret, about eleven years of age, afterwards married to James,
King of Scots; and on his left played Mary, a child of four. Edmund
was an infant in arms. More, with his companion Arnold,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page023" name="page023"></a>(p. 023)</span>
after paying his respects to the boy Henry, the same that is now King
of England, presented him with some writing. For my part, not having
expected anything of the sort, I had nothing to offer, but promised
that, on another occasion, I would in some way declare my duty towards
him. Meantime, I was angry with More for not having warned me,
especially as the boy sent me a little note, while we were at dinner,
to challenge something from my pen. I went home, and in the Muses'
spite, from whom I had been so long divorced, finished the poem within
three days." The
poem,<a id="footnotetag50" name="footnotetag50"></a><a href="#footnote50">[50]</a>
in which Britain speaks her own praise and
that of her princes, Henry VII. and his children, was dedicated to the
Duke of York and accompanied by a letter in which Erasmus commended
Henry's devotion to learning. Seven years later Erasmus again wrote to
Henry, now Prince of Wales, condoling with him upon the death of his
brother-in-law, Philip of Burgundy, King of Castile. Henry replied in
cordial manner, inviting the great scholar to continue the
correspondence. The style of his letter so impressed Erasmus that he
suspected, as he
says,<a id="footnotetag51" name="footnotetag51"></a><a href="#footnote51">[51]</a>
"some help from others in the ideas and
expressions. In a conversation I afterwards had with William, Lord
Mountjoy, he tried by various arguments to dispel that suspicion, and
when he found he could not do so he gave up the point and let it pass
until he was sufficiently instructed in the case. On another occasion,
when we were talking alone together, he brought out a number of the
Prince's letters, some to other people and some to himself, and among
them one which answered to mine: in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page024" name="page024"></a>(p. 024)</span>
these letters were
manifest signs of comment, addition, suppression, correction and
alteration&mdash;You might recognise the first drafting of a letter, and
you might make out the second and third, and sometimes even the fourth
correction; but whatever was revised or added was in the same
handwriting. I had then no further grounds for hesitation, and,
overcome by the facts, I laid aside all suspicion." Neither, he adds,
would his correspondent doubt Henry VIII's authorship of the book
against Luther if he knew that king's "happy genius". That famous book
is sufficient proof that theological studies held no small place in
Henry's education. They were cast in the traditional mould, for the
Lancastrians were very orthodox, and the early Tudors followed in
their steps. Margaret Beaufort left her husband to devote herself to
good works and a semi-monastic life; Henry VII. converted a heretic at
the stake and left him to
burn;<a id="footnotetag52" name="footnotetag52"></a><a href="#footnote52">[52]</a>
and the theological conservatism,
which Henry VIII. imbibed in youth, clung to him to the end of his
days.</p>

<p>Nor were the arts neglected, and in his early years Henry acquired a
passionate and lifelong devotion to music. Even as Duke of York he had
a band of minstrels apart from those of the King and Prince
Arthur;<a id="footnotetag53" name="footnotetag53"></a><a href="#footnote53">[53]</a>
and when he was king his minstrels formed an indispensable
part of his retinue, whether he went on progress through his kingdom,
or crossed the seas on errands of peace or
war.<a id="footnotetag54" name="footnotetag54"></a><a href="#footnote54">[54]</a>
He became an
expert performer on the lute, the organ and the harpsichord, and all
the cares of State could not divert him from practising on those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page025" name="page025"></a>(p. 025)</span>
instruments both day and night. He sent all over England in
search of singing men and boys for the chapel royal, and sometimes
appropriated choristers from Wolsey's chapel, which he thought better
provided than his
own.<a id="footnotetag55" name="footnotetag55"></a><a href="#footnote55">[55]</a>
From Venice he enticed to England the
organist of St. Mark's, Dionysius Memo, and on occasion Henry and his
Court listened four hours at a stretch to Memo's organ
recitals.<a id="footnotetag56" name="footnotetag56"></a><a href="#footnote56">[56]</a>
Not only did he take delight in the practice of music by himself and
others; he also studied its theory and wrote with the skill of an
expert. Vocal and instrumental pieces of his own composition,
preserved among the manuscripts at the British
Museum,<a id="footnotetag57" name="footnotetag57"></a><a href="#footnote57">[57]</a>
rank among
the best productions of the time; and one of his anthems, "O Lorde,
the Maker of all thyng," is of the highest order of merit, and still
remains a favourite in English cathedrals.</p>

<p>In April, 1502, at the age of ten, Henry became the heir-apparent to
the English throne. He succeeded at once to the dukedom of Cornwall,
but again a precedent was set which was followed but yesterday; and
ten months were allowed to elapse before he was, on 18th February,
1503, created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, the dukedom of York
becoming void until a king or an heir apparent should again have a
second son.<a id="footnotetag58" name="footnotetag58"></a><a href="#footnote58">[58]</a>
The first sign of his increased importance was his
implication in the maze of matrimonial intrigues which formed so large
a part of sixteenth-century diplomacy. The last thing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page026" name="page026"></a>(p. 026)</span>
kings
considered was the domestic felicity of their children; their
marriages were pieces in the diplomatic game and sometimes the means
by which States were built up. While Duke of York, Henry had been
proposed as a husband for Eleanor,<a id="footnotetag59" name="footnotetag59"></a><a href="#footnote59">[59]</a>
daughter of the Archduke
Philip; and his sister Mary as the bride of Philip's son Charles, who,
as the heir of the houses of Castile and of Aragon, of Burgundy and of
Austria, was from the cradle destined to wield the imperial sceptre of
Cæsar. No further steps were taken at the time, and Prince Arthur's
death brought other projects to the front.</p>

<p>Immediately on receiving the news, and two days before they dated
their letter of condolence to Henry VII., Ferdinand and Isabella
commissioned the Duke of Estrada to negotiate a marriage between the
widowed Catherine and her youthful
brother-in-law.<a id="footnotetag60" name="footnotetag60"></a><a href="#footnote60">[60]</a>
No doubt was
entertained but that the Pope would grant the necessary dispensation,
for the spiritual head of Christendom was apt to look tenderly on the
petitions of the powerful princes of this world. A more serious
difficulty was the question of the widow's dower. Part only had been
paid, and Ferdinand not merely refused to hand over the rest, but
demanded the return of his previous instalments. Henry, on the other
hand, considered himself entitled to the whole, refused to refund a
penny, and gave a cold reception to the proposed marriage between
Catherine and his sole surviving son. He was, however, by no means
blind to the advantages of the Spanish matrimonial and political
alliance, and still less to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page027" name="page027"></a>(p. 027)</span>
the attractions of Catherine's
dower; he declined to send back the Princess, when Isabella, shocked
at Henry VII.'s proposal to marry his daughter-in-law himself,
demanded her return; and eventually, when Ferdinand reduced his terms,
he suffered the marriage treaty to be signed. On 25th June, 1503,
Prince Henry and Catherine were solemnly betrothed in the Bishop of
Salisbury's house, in Fleet Street.</p>

<p>The papal dispensation arrived in time to solace Isabella on her
death-bed in November, 1504; but that event once more involved in
doubt the prospects of the marriage. The crown of Castile passed from
Isabella to her daughter Juaña; the government of the kingdom was
claimed by Ferdinand and by Juaña's husband, Philip of Burgundy. On
their way from the Netherlands to claim their inheritance, Philip and
Juaña were driven on English shores. Henry VII. treated them with all
possible courtesy, and made Philip a Knight of the Garter, while
Philip repaid the compliment by investing Prince Henry with the Order
of the Golden Fleece.<a id="footnotetag61" name="footnotetag61"></a><a href="#footnote61">[61]</a>
But advantage was taken of Philip's plight
to extort from him the surrender of the Earl of Suffolk, styled the
White Rose, and a commercial treaty with the Netherlands, which the
Flemings named the Malus Intercursus. Three months after his arrival
in Castile, Philip died, and Henry began to fish in the troubled
waters for a share in his dominions. Two marriage schemes occurred to
him; he might win the hand of Philip's sister Margaret, now Regent of
the Netherlands, and with her hand the control of those provinces; or
he might marry Juaña and claim in her right to administer Castile. On
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page028" name="page028"></a>(p. 028)</span>
the acquisition of Castile he set his mind. If he could not
gain it by marriage with Juaña, he thought he could do so by marrying
her son and heir, the infant Charles, to his daughter Mary. Whichever
means he took to further his design, it would naturally irritate
Ferdinand and make him less anxious for the completion of the marriage
between Catherine and Prince Henry. Henry VII. was equally averse from
the consummation of the match. Now that he was scheming with Charles's
other grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian, to wrest the government of
Castile from Ferdinand's grasp, the alliance of the King of Aragon had
lost its attraction, and it was possible that the Prince of Wales
might find elsewhere a more desirable bride. Henry's marriage with
Catherine was to have been accomplished when he completed the age of
fourteen; but on the eve of his fifteenth birthday he made a solemn
protestation that the contract was null and void, and that he would
not carry out his
engagements.<a id="footnotetag62" name="footnotetag62"></a><a href="#footnote62">[62]</a>
This protest left him free to
consider other proposals, and enhanced his value as a negotiable
asset. More than once negotiations were started for marrying him to
Marguerite de Valois, sister of the Duke of Angoulême, afterwards
famous as Francis
I.;<a id="footnotetag63" name="footnotetag63"></a><a href="#footnote63">[63]</a>
and in the last months of his father's
reign, the Prince of Wales was giving audience to ambassadors from
Maximilian, who came to suggest matrimonial alliances between the
prince and a daughter of Duke Albert of Bavaria, and between Henry
VII. and the Lady Margaret of Savoy, Regent of the
Netherlands.<a id="footnotetag64" name="footnotetag64"></a><a href="#footnote64">[64]</a>
Meanwhile, Ferdinand, threatened
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page029" name="page029"></a>(p. 029)</span>
on all sides, first came to
terms with France; he married a French princess, Germaine de Foix,
abandoned his claim to Navarre, and bought the security of Naples by
giving Louis XII. a free hand in the north of Italy. He then diverted
Maximilian from his designs on Castile by humouring his hostility to
Venice. By that bait he succeeded in drawing off his enemies, and the
league of Cambrai united them all, Ferdinand and Louis, Emperor and
Pope, in an iniquitous attack on the Italian Republic. Henry VII.,
fortunately for his reputation, was left out of the compact. He was
still cherishing his design on Castile, and in December, 1508, the
treaty of marriage between Mary and Charles was formally signed. It
was the last of his worldly triumphs; the days of his life were
numbered, and in the early months of 1509 he was engaged in making a
peace with his conscience.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>The twenty-four years during which Henry VII. had guided the destinies
of England were a momentous epoch in the development of Western
civilisation. It was the dawn of modern history, of the history of
Europe in the form in which we know it to-day. The old order was in a
state of liquidation. The mediæval ideal, described by Dante, of a
universal monarchy with two aspects, spiritual and temporal, and two
heads, emperor and pope, was passing away. Its place was taken by the
modern but narrower ideal of separate polities, each pursuing its own
course, independent of, and often in conflict with, other societies.
Unity gave way to diversity of tongues, of churches, of states; and
the cosmopolitan became nationalist, patriot, separatist. Imperial
monarchy shrank to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page030" name="page030"></a>(p. 030)</span>
a shadow; and kings divided the emperor's
power at the same time that they consolidated their own. They extended
their authority on both sides, at the expense of their superior, the
emperor, and at the expense of their subordinate feudal lords. The
struggle between the disruptive forces of feudalism and the central
power of monarchy ended at last in monarchical triumph; and internal
unity prepared the way for external expansion. France under Louis XI.
was first in the field. She had surmounted her civil troubles half a
century earlier than England. She then expelled her foreign foes,
crushed the remnants of feudal independence, and began to expand at
the cost of weaker States. Parts of Burgundy, Provence, and Brittany
became merged in France; the exuberant strength of the new-formed
nation burst the barriers of the Alps and overflowed into the plains
of Italy. The time of universal monarchy was past, but the dread of it
remained; and from Charles VIII.'s invasion of Italy in 1494 to
Francis I.'s defeat at Pavia in 1525, French dreams of world-wide
sovereignty were the nightmare of other kings. Those dreams might, as
Europe feared, have been realised, had not other States followed
France in the path of internal consolidation. Ferdinand of Aragon
married Isabella of Castile, drove out the Moors, and founded the
modern Spanish kingdom. Maximilian married Mary, the daughter of
Charles the Bold, and joined the Netherlands to Austria. United France
found herself face to face with other united States, and the political
system of modern Europe was roughly sketched out. The boundaries of
the various kingdoms were fluctuating. There still remained minor
principalities and powers, chiefly in Italy and Germany, which offered
an easy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page031" name="page031"></a>(p. 031)</span>
prey to their ambitious neighbours; for both nations
had sacrificed internal unity to the shadow of universal dominion,
Germany in temporal, and Italy in spiritual, things. Mutual jealousy
of each other's growth at the expense of these States gave rise to the
theory of the balance of power; mutual adjustment of each other's
disputes produced international law; and the necessity of watching
each other's designs begat modern
diplomacy.<a id="footnotetag65" name="footnotetag65"></a><a href="#footnote65">[65]</a></p>

<p>Parallel with these developments in the relations between one State
and another marched a no less momentous revolution in the domestic
position of their sovereigns. National expansion abroad was marked by
a corresponding growth in royal authority at home. The process was not
new in England; every step in the path of the tribal chief of Saxon
pirates to the throne of a united England denoted an advance in the
nature of kingly power. Each extension of his sway intensified his
authority, and his power grew in degree as it increased in area. So
with fifteenth-century sovereigns. Local liberties and feudal rights
which had checked a Duke of Brittany or a King of Aragon were
powerless to restrain the King of France or of Spain. The sphere of
royal authority encroached upon all others; all functions and all
powers tended to concentrate in royal hands. The king was the emblem
of national unity, the centre of national aspirations, and the object
of national reverence. The Renaissance gave fresh impetus to the
movement. Men turned not only to the theology, literature, and art of
the early Christian era; they began to study anew its political
organisation and its system of law and jurisprudence. The code of
Justinian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page032" name="page032"></a>(p. 032)</span>
was as much a revelation as the original Greek of
the New Testament. Roman imperial law seemed as superior to the
barbarities of common law as classical was to mediæval Latin; and
Roman law supplanted indigenous systems in France and in Germany, in
Spain and in Scotland. Both the Roman imperial law and the Roman
imperial constitution were useful models for kings of the New
Monarchy; the Roman Empire was a despotism; <i>quod principi placuit
legis habet vigorem</i> ran the fundamental principle of Roman
Empire.<a id="footnotetag66" name="footnotetag66"></a><a href="#footnote66">[66]</a>
Nor was this all; Roman emperors were habitually deified,
and men in the sixteenth century seemed to pay to their kings while
alive the Divine honours which Romans paid to their emperors when
dead. "Le nouveau Messie," says Michelet, "est le
roi."<a id="footnotetag67" name="footnotetag67"></a><a href="#footnote67">[67]</a></p>

<p>Nowhere was the king more emphatically the saviour of society than in
England. The sixty years of Lancastrian rule were in the seventeenth
century represented as the golden age of parliamentary government, a
sort of time before the fall to which popular orators appealed when
they wished to paint in vivid colours the evils of Stuart tyranny. But
to keen observers of the time the pre-eminent characteristic of
Lancastrian rule appeared to be its "lack of governance" or, in modern
phrase, administrative
anarchy.<a id="footnotetag68" name="footnotetag68"></a><a href="#footnote68">[68]</a>
There was no subordination in the
State. The weakness of the Lancastrian title left the king at the
mercy of Parliament, and the limitations of Parliament
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page033" name="page033"></a>(p. 033)</span>
were
never more apparent than when its powers stood highest. Even in the
realm of legislation, the statute book has seldom been so barren. Its
principal acts were to narrow the county electorate to an oligarchy,
to restrict the choice of constituencies to resident knights and
burgesses, and to impair its own influence as a focus of public
opinion. It was not content with legislative authority; it interfered
with an executive which it could hamper but could not control. It was
possessed by the inveterate fallacy that freedom and strong government
are things incompatible; that the executive is the natural enemy of
the Legislature; that if one is strong, the other must be weak; and of
the two alternatives it vastly preferred a weak executive. So, to
limit the king's power, it sought to make him "live of his own," when
"his own" was absolutely inadequate to meet the barest necessities of
government. Parliament was in fact irresponsible; the connecting link
between it and the executive had yet to be found. Hence the
Lancastrian "lack of governance"; it ended in a generation of civil
war, and the memory of that anarchy explains much in Tudor history.</p>

<p>The problems of Henry VIII.'s reign can indeed only be solved by
realising the misrule of the preceding century, the failure of
parliamentary government, and the strength of the popular demand for a
firm and masterful hand. It is a modern myth that Englishmen have
always been consumed with enthusiasm for parliamentary government and
with a thirst for a parliamentary vote. The interpretation of history,
like that of the Scriptures, varies from age to age; and present
political theories colour our views of the past. The political
development of the nineteenth century created a parliamentary legend;
and civil
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page034" name="page034"></a>(p. 034)</span>
and religious liberty became the inseparable stage
properties of the Englishman. Whenever he appeared on the boards, he
was made to declaim about the rights of the subject and the privileges
of Parliament. It was assumed that the desire for a voice in the
management of his own affairs had at all times and all seasons been
the mainspring of his actions; and so the story of Henry's rule was
made into a political mystery. In reality, love of freedom has not
always been, nor will it always remain, the predominant note in the
English mind. At times the English people have pursued it through
battle and murder with grim determination, but other times have seen
other ideals. On occasion the demand has been for strong government
irrespective of its methods, and good government has been preferred to
self-government. Wars of expansion and wars of defence have often
cooled the love of liberty and impaired the faith in parliaments; and
generally English ideals have been strictly subordinated to a passion
for material prosperity.</p>

<p>Never was this more apparent than under the Tudors. The parliamentary
experiment of the Lancastrians was premature and had failed.
Parliamentary institutions were discredited and people were
indifferent to parliamentary rights and privileges: "A plague on both
your Houses," was the popular feeling, "give us peace, above all peace
at home to pursue new avenues of wealth, new phases of commercial
development, peace to study new problems of literature, religion, and
art"; and both Houses passed out of the range of popular imagination,
and almost out of the sphere of independent political action.
Parliament played during the sixteenth century a modester part than it
had played since its creation. Towards
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page035" name="page035"></a>(p. 035)</span>
the close of the
period Shakespeare wrote his play of <i>King John</i>, and in that play
there is not the faintest allusion to Magna
Carta.<a id="footnotetag69" name="footnotetag69"></a><a href="#footnote69">[69]</a>
Such an
omission would be inconceivable now or at any time since the death of
Elizabeth; for the Great Charter is enshrined in popular imagination
as the palladium of the British constitution. It was the fetish to
which Parliament appealed against the Stuarts. But no such appeal
would have touched a Tudor audience. It needed and desired no weapon
against a sovereign who embodied national desires, and ruled in accord
with the national will. References to the charter are as rare in
parliamentary debates as they are in the pages of Shakespeare. The
best hated instruments of Stuart tyranny were popular institutions
under the Tudors; and the Star Chamber itself found its main
difficulty in the number of suitors which flocked to a court where the
king was judge, the law's delays minimised, counsel's fees moderate,
and justice rarely denied merely because it might happen to be
illegal. England in the sixteenth century put its trust in its princes
far more than it did in its parliaments; it invested them with
attributes almost Divine. By Tudor majesty the poet was inspired with
thoughts of the divinity that doth hedge a king. "Love for the King,"
wrote a Venetian of Henry VIII. in the early years of his reign, "is
universal with all who see him, for his Highness does not seem a
person of this world, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page036" name="page036"></a>(p. 036)</span>
one descended from
heaven."<a id="footnotetag70" name="footnotetag70"></a><a href="#footnote70">[70]</a>
<i>Le nouveau Messie est le Roi.</i></p>

<p>Such were the tendencies which Henry VII. and Henry VIII. crystallised
into practical weapons of absolute government. Few kings have attained
a greater measure of permanent success than the first of the Tudors;
it was he who laid the unseen foundations upon which Henry VIII.
erected the imposing edifice of his personal authority. An orphan from
birth and an exile from childhood, he stood near enough to the throne
to invite Yorkist proscription, but too far off to unite in his favour
Lancastrian support. He owed his elevation to the mistakes of his
enemies and to the cool, calculating craft which enabled him to use
those mistakes without making mistakes of his own. He ran the great
risk of his life in his invasion of England, but henceforth he left
nothing to chance. He was never betrayed by passion or enthusiasm into
rash adventures, and he loved the substance, rather than the pomp and
circumstance of power. Untrammelled by scruples, unimpeded by
principles, he pursued with constant fidelity the task of his life, to
secure the throne for himself and his children, to pacify his country,
and to repair the waste of the civil wars. Folly easily glides into
war, but to establish a permanent peace required all Henry's patience,
clear sight and far sight, caution and tenacity. A full exchequer, not
empty glory, was his first requisite, and he found in his foreign wars
a mine of money. Treason at home was turned to like profit, and the
forfeited estates of rebellious lords accumulated in the hands of the
royal family and filled the national coffers. Attainder, the
characteristic instrument of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page037" name="page037"></a>(p. 037)</span>
Tudor policy, was employed to
complete the ruin of the old English peerage which the Wars of the
Roses began: and by 1509 there was only one duke and one marquis left
in the whole of
England.<a id="footnotetag71" name="footnotetag71"></a><a href="#footnote71">[71]</a>
Attainder not only removed the particular
traitor, but disqualified his family for place and power; and the
process of eliminating feudalism from the region of government,
started by Edward I., was finished by Henry VII. Feudal society has
been described as a pyramid; the upper slopes were now washed away
leaving an impassable precipice, with the Tudor monarch alone in his
glory at its summit. Royalty had become a caste apart. Marriages
between royal children and English peers had hitherto been no uncommon
thing; since Henry VII.'s accession there have been but four, two of
them in our own day. Only one took place in the sixteenth century, and
the Duke of Suffolk was by some thought worthy of death for his
presumption in marrying the sister of Henry VIII. The peerage was
weakened not only by diminishing numbers, but by the systematic
depression of those who remained. Henry VII., like Ferdinand of
Aragon,<a id="footnotetag72" name="footnotetag72"></a><a href="#footnote72">[72]</a>
preferred to govern by means of lawyers and churchmen;
they could be rewarded by judgeships and bishoprics, and required no
grants from the royal estates. Their occupancy of office kept out
territorial magnates who abused it for private ends. Of the sixteen
regents nominated by Henry VIII. in his will, not one could boast a
peerage of twelve years'
standing;<a id="footnotetag73" name="footnotetag73"></a><a href="#footnote73">[73]</a>
and all the great Tudor
ministers,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page038" name="page038"></a>(p. 038)</span>
Wolsey and Cromwell, Cecil and Walsingham, were
men of comparatively humble birth. With similar objects Henry VII.
passed laws limiting the number of retainers and forbidding the
practice of maintenance. The courts of Star Chamber and Requests were
developed to keep in order his powerful subjects and give poor men
protection against them. Their civil law procedure, influenced by
Roman imperial maxims, served to enhance the royal power and dignity,
and helped to build up the Tudor autocracy.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>To the office of king thus developed and magnified, the young Prince
who stood upon the steps of the throne brought personal qualities of
the highest order, and advantages to which his father was completely a
stranger. His title was secure, his treasury overflowed, and he
enjoyed the undivided affections of his people. There was no
alternative claimant. The White Rose, indeed, had languished in the
Tower since his surrender by Philip, and the Duke of Buckingham had
some years before been mentioned as a possible successor to the
throne;<a id="footnotetag74" name="footnotetag74"></a><a href="#footnote74">[74]</a>
but their claims only served to remind men that nothing
but Henry's life stood between them and anarchy, for his young brother
Edmund, Duke of Somerset, had preceded Arthur to an early grave. Upon
the single thread of Henry's life hung the peace of the realm; no
other could have secured the throne without a second civil war. It was
small wonder if England regarded Henry with a somewhat extravagant
loyalty. Never had king ascended the throne more richly endowed with
mental and physical gifts. He was ten weeks short of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page039" name="page039"></a>(p. 039)</span>
eighteenth year. From both his parents he inherited grace of mind and
of person. His father in later years was broken in health and soured
in spirit, but in the early days of his reign he had charmed the
citizens of York with his winning smile. His mother is described by
the Venetian ambassador as a woman of great beauty and ability. She
transmitted to Henry many of the popular characteristics of her
father, Edward IV., though little of the military genius of that
consummate commander who fought thirteen pitched battles and lost not
one. Unless eye-witnesses sadly belied themselves, Henry VIII. must
have been the desire of all eyes. "His Majesty," wrote one a year or
two later,<a id="footnotetag75" name="footnotetag75"></a><a href="#footnote75">[75]</a>
"is the handsomest potentate I ever set eyes on; above
the usual height, with an extremely fine calf to his leg; his
complexion fair and bright, with auburn hair combed straight and short
in the French fashion, and a round face so very beautiful that it
would become a pretty woman, his throat being rather long and
thick.... He speaks French, English, Latin, and a little Italian;
plays well on the lute and harpsichord, sings from the book at sight,
draws the bow with greater strength than any man in England, and
jousts marvellously." Another foreign resident in
1519<a id="footnotetag76" name="footnotetag76"></a><a href="#footnote76">[76]</a>
described
him as "extremely handsome. Nature could not have done more for him.
He is much handsomer than any other sovereign in Christendom; a great
deal handsomer than the King of France; very fair and his whole frame
admirably proportioned. On hearing that Francis I. wore a beard, he
allowed his own to grow, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page040" name="page040"></a>(p. 040)</span>
as it is reddish, he has now
got a beard that looks like gold. He is very accomplished, a good
musician, composes well, is a capital horseman, a fine jouster, speaks
French, Latin, and Spanish.... He is very fond of hunting, and never
takes his diversion without tiring eight or ten horses which he causes
to be stationed beforehand along the line of country he means to take,
and when one is tired he mounts another, and before he gets home they
are all exhausted. He is extremely fond of tennis, at which game it is
the prettiest thing in the world to see him play, his fair skin
glowing through a shirt of the finest texture."</p>

<p>The change from the cold suspicious Henry VII. to such a king as this
was inevitably greeted with a burst of rapturous enthusiasm. "I have
no fear," wrote Mountjoy to
Erasmus,<a id="footnotetag77" name="footnotetag77"></a><a href="#footnote77">[77]</a>
"but when you heard that our
Prince, now Henry the Eighth, whom we may well call our Octavius, had
succeeded to his father's throne, all your melancholy left you at
once. For what may you not promise yourself from a Prince, with whose
extraordinary and almost Divine character you are well acquainted....
But when you know what a hero he now shows himself, how wisely he
behaves, what a lover he is of justice and goodness, what affection he
bears to the learned, I will venture to swear that you will need no
wings to make you fly to behold this new and auspicious star. If you
could see how all the world here is rejoicing in the possession of so
great a Prince, how his life is all their desire, you could not
contain your tears for joy. The heavens laugh, the earth exults, all
things are full of milk, of honey, of nectar! Avarice is expelled the
country. Liberality
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page041" name="page041"></a>(p. 041)</span>
 scatters wealth with a bounteous hand.
Our King does not desire gold or gems or precious metals, but virtue,
glory, immortality." The picture is overdrawn for modern taste, but
making due allowance for Mountjoy's turgid efforts to emulate his
master's eloquence, enough remains to indicate the impression made by
Henry on a peer of liberal education. His unrivalled skill in national
sports and martial exercises appealed at least as powerfully to the
mass of his people. In archery, in wrestling, in joust and in tourney,
as well as in the tennis court or on the hunting field, Henry was a
match for the best in his kingdom. None could draw a bow, tame a
steed, or shiver a lance more deftly than he, and his single-handed
tournaments on horse and foot with his brother-in-law, the Duke of
Suffolk, are likened by one who watched them to the combats of
Achilles and Hector. These are no mere trifles below the dignity of
history; they help to explain the extraordinary hold Henry obtained
over popular imagination. Suppose there ascended the throne to-day a
young prince, the hero of the athletic world, the finest oar, the best
bat, the crack marksman of his day, it is easy to imagine the
enthusiastic support he would receive from thousands of his people who
care much for sport, and nothing at all for politics. Suppose also
that that prince were endowed with the iron will, the instinctive
insight into the hearts of his people, the profound aptitude for
government that Henry VIII. displayed, he would be a rash man who
would guarantee even now the integrity of parliamentary power or the
continuance of cabinet rule. In those days, with thirty years of civil
war and fifteen more of conspiracy fresh in men's minds, with no
alternative to anarchy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page042" name="page042"></a>(p. 042)</span>
save Henry VIII., with a peerage
fallen from its high estate, and a Parliament almost lost to respect,
royal autocracy was not a thing to dread or distrust. "If a lion knew
his strength," said Sir Thomas More of his master to Cromwell, "it
were hard for any man to rule him." Henry VIII. had the strength of a
lion; it remains to be seen how soon he learnt it, and what use he
made of that strength when he discovered the secret.</p>





<h3>CHAPTER III.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page043" name="page043"></a>(p. 043)</span></h3>

<h4>THE APPRENTICESHIP OF HENRY VIII.</h4>


<p>Quietly and peacefully, without a threat from abroad or a murmur at
home, the crown, which his father had won amid the storm and stress of
the field of battle, devolved upon Henry VIII. With an eager profusion
of zeal Ferdinand of Aragon placed at Henry's disposal his army, his
fleet, his personal
services.<a id="footnotetag78" name="footnotetag78"></a><a href="#footnote78">[78]</a>
There was no call for this
sacrifice. For generations there had been no such tranquil demise of
the crown. Not a ripple disturbed the surface of affairs as the old
King lay sick in April, 1509, in Richmond Palace at Sheen. By his
bedside stood his only surviving son; and to him the dying monarch
addressed his last words of advice. He desired him to complete his
marriage with Catherine, he exhorted him to defend the Church, and to
make war on the infidel; he commended to him his faithful councillors,
and is believed to have urged upon him the execution of De la Pole,
Earl of Suffolk, the White Rose of England. On the 22nd he was dead. A
fortnight later the funeral procession wended its way from Sheen to
St. Paul's, where the illustrious John Fisher, cardinal and martyr,
preached the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page044" name="page044"></a>(p. 044)</span>
<i>éloge</i>. Thence it passed down the Strand,
between hedges and willows clad in the fresh green of spring, to</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="poem1">That acre sown indeed</span><br>
With the richest, royallest seed<br>
That the earth did e'er drink in.
</p>

<p>There, in the vault beneath the chapel in Westminster Abbey, which
bears his name and testifies to his magnificence in building, Henry
VII. was laid to rest beside his Queen; dwelling, says Bacon, "more
richly dead in the monument of his tomb than he did alive in Richmond
or any of his palaces". For years before and after, Torrigiano, the
rival of Buonarotti, wrought at its "matchless altar," not a stone of
which survived the Puritan fury of the civil war.</p>

<p>On the day of his father's death, or the next, the new King removed
from Richmond Palace to the Tower, whence, on 23rd April, was dated
the first official act of his reign. He confirmed in ampler form the
general pardon granted a few days before by Henry VII.; but the ampler
form was no bar to the exemption of fourscore offenders from the act
of grace.<a id="footnotetag79" name="footnotetag79"></a><a href="#footnote79">[79]</a>
Foremost among them were the three brothers De la Pole,
Sir Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley. The exclusion of Empson and
Dudley from the pardon was more popular than the pardon itself. If
anything could have enhanced Henry's favour with his subjects, it was
the condign punishment of the tools of his father's extortion. Their
death was none the less welcome for being unjust. They were not merely
refused pardon and brought to the block; a more costly concession was
made when their bonds for the payment of loans were
cancelled.<a id="footnotetag80" name="footnotetag80"></a><a href="#footnote80">[80]</a>
Their victims, so runs
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page045" name="page045"></a>(p. 045)</span>
the official record, had been
"without any ground or matter of truth, by the undue means of certain
of the council of our said late father, thereunto driven contrary to
law, reason and good conscience, to the manifest charge and peril of
the soul of our said late father".</p>

<p>If filial piety demanded the delivery of his father's soul from peril,
it counselled no less the fulfilment of his dying requests, and the
arrangements for Catherine's marriage were hurried on with an almost
indecent haste. The instant he heard rumours of Henry VII.'s death,
Ferdinand sent warning to his envoy in England that Louis of France
and others would seek by all possible means to break off the
match.<a id="footnotetag81" name="footnotetag81"></a><a href="#footnote81">[81]</a>
To further it, he would withdraw his objections to the
union of Charles and Mary; and a few days later he wrote again to
remove any scruples Henry might entertain about marrying his deceased
brother's wife; while to Catherine herself he declared with brutal
frankness that she would get no other husband than
Henry.<a id="footnotetag82" name="footnotetag82"></a><a href="#footnote82">[82]</a>
All his
paternal anxiety might have been spared. Long before Ferdinand's
persuasions could reach Henry's ears, he had made up his mind to
consummate the marriage. He would not, he wrote to Margaret of
Savoy,<a id="footnotetag83" name="footnotetag83"></a><a href="#footnote83">[83]</a>
disobey his father's commands, reinforced as they were by
the dispensation of the Pope and by the friendship between the two
families contracted by his sister Mary's betrothal to Catherine's
nephew Charles. There were other reasons besides those he alleged. A
council trained by Henry VII. was loth to lose the gold of Catherine's
dower; it was of the utmost importance to strengthen at once the royal
line; and a full-blooded youth of Henry's temperament was not likely
to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page046" name="page046"></a>(p. 046)</span>
repel a comely wife ready to his hand, when the dictates
of his father's policy no longer stood between them. So on 11th June,
barely a month after Henry VII.'s obsequies, the marriage, big with
destinies, of Henry VIII. and Catherine of Aragon was privately
solemnised by Archbishop Warham "in the Queen's closet" at
Greenwich.<a id="footnotetag84" name="footnotetag84"></a><a href="#footnote84">[84]</a>
On the same day the commission of claims was appointed
for the King's and Queen's coronation. A week then sufficed for its
business, and on Sunday, 24th June, the Abbey was the scene of a
second State function within three months. Its splendour and display
were emblematic of the coming reign. Warham placed the crown on the
King's head; the people cried, "Yea, yea!" in a loud voice when asked
if they would have Henry as King; Sir Robert Dymock performed the
office of champion; and a banquet, jousts and tourneys concluded the
ceremonies.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>Though he had wedded a wife and been crowned a king, Henry was as yet
little more than a boy. A powerful mind ripens slowly in a vigorous
frame, and Henry's childish precocity had given way before a youthful
devotion to physical sports. He was no prodigy of early development.
His intellect, will and character were of a gradual, healthier growth;
they were not matured for many years after he came to the throne. He
was still in his eighteenth year; and like most young Englishmen of
means and muscle, his interests centred rather in the field than in
the study. Youth sat on the prow and pleasure at the helm. "Continual
feasting" was the phrase in which Catherine described their early
married life.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page047" name="page047"></a>(p. 047)</span>
In the winter evenings there were masks and
comedies, romps and revels, in which Henry himself, Bessie Blount and
other young ladies of his Court played
parts.<a id="footnotetag85" name="footnotetag85"></a><a href="#footnote85">[85]</a>
In the spring and
summer there were archery and tennis. Music, we are told, was
practised day and night. Two months after his accession Henry wrote to
Ferdinand that he diverted himself with jousts, birding, hunting, and
other innocent and honest pastimes, in visiting various parts of his
kingdom, but that he did not therefore neglect affairs of
State.<a id="footnotetag86" name="footnotetag86"></a><a href="#footnote86">[86]</a>
Possibly he was as assiduous in his duties as modern university
athletes in their studies; the neglect was merely comparative. But
Ferdinand's ambassador remarked on Henry's aversion to business, and
his councillors complained that he cared only for the pleasures of his
age. Two days a week, said the Spaniard, were devoted to single
combats on foot, initiated in imitation of the heroes of romance,
Amadis and
Lancelot;<a id="footnotetag87" name="footnotetag87"></a><a href="#footnote87">[87]</a>
and if Henry's other innocent and honest
pastimes were equally exacting, his view of the requirements of State
may well have been modest. From the earliest days of his reign the
general outline of policy was framed in accord with his sentiments,
and he was probably consulted on most questions of importance. But it
was not always so; in August, 1509, Louis XII. acknowledged a letter
purporting to come from the English King with a request for friendship
and peace. "Who wrote this letter?" burst out Henry. "I ask peace of
the King of France, who dare not look me in the face, still less make
war on
me!"<a id="footnotetag88" name="footnotetag88"></a><a href="#footnote88">[88]</a>
His pride at the age of eighteen was not less than his
ignorance of what passed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page048" name="page048"></a>(p. 048)</span>
in his name. He had yet to learn
the secret that painful and laborious mastery of detail is essential
to him who aspires not merely to reign but to rule; and matters of
detail in administration and diplomacy were still left in his
ministers' hands.</p>

<p>With the exception of Empson and Dudley, Henry made little or no
change in the council his father bequeathed him. Official precedence
appertained to his Chancellor, Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury. Like
most of Henry VII.'s prelates, he received his preferment in the
Church as a reward for services to the State. Much of the diplomatic
work of the previous reign had passed through his hands; he helped to
arrange the marriage of Arthur and Catherine, and was employed in the
vain attempt to obtain Margaret of Savoy as a bride for Henry VII. As
Archbishop he crowned and married Henry VIII., and as Chancellor he
delivered orations at the opening of the young King's first three
Parliaments.<a id="footnotetag89" name="footnotetag89"></a><a href="#footnote89">[89]</a>
They are said to have given general satisfaction, but
apart from them, Warham, for some unknown reason, took little part in
political business. So far as Henry can be said at this time to have
had a Prime Minister, that title belongs to Fox, his Lord Privy Seal
and Bishop of Winchester. Fox had been even more active than Warham in
politics, and more closely linked with the personal fortunes of the
two Tudor kings. He had shared the exile of Henry of Richmond; the
treaty of Étaples, the Intercursus Magnus, the marriage of Henry's
elder daughter to James IV., and the betrothal of his younger to
Charles, were largely the work of his hands. Malicious gossip
described him as willing to consent to his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page049" name="page049"></a>(p. 049)</span>
own father's
death to serve the turn of his king, and a better founded belief
ascribed to his wit the invention of "Morton's
fork".<a id="footnotetag90" name="footnotetag90"></a><a href="#footnote90">[90]</a>
He was
Chancellor of Cambridge in 1500, as Warham was of Oxford, but won more
enduring fame by founding the college of Corpus Christi in the
university over which the Archbishop presided. He had baptised Henry
VIII. and advocated his marriage to Catherine; and to him the King
extended the largest share in his confidence. Badoer, the Venetian
ambassador, called him "alter
rex,"<a id="footnotetag91" name="footnotetag91"></a><a href="#footnote91">[91]</a>
and Carroz, the Spaniard, said
Henry trusted him most; but Henry was not blind to the failings of his
most intimate councillors, and he warned Carroz that the Bishop of
Winchester was, as his name implied, a fox
indeed.<a id="footnotetag92" name="footnotetag92"></a><a href="#footnote92">[92]</a>
A third
prelate, Ruthal of Durham, divided with Fox the chief business of
State; and these clerical advisers were supposed to be eager to guide
Henry's footsteps in the paths of peace, and counteract the more
adventurous tendencies of their lay colleagues.</p>

<p>At the head of the latter stood Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, soon to
be rewarded for his victory at Flodden by his restoration to the
dukedom of Norfolk. He and his son, the third duke, were Lord High
Treasurers throughout Henry's reign; but jealousy of their past, Tudor
distrust of their rank, or personal limitations, impaired the
authority that would otherwise have attached to their official
position; and Henry never trusted them as he did ministers whom he
himself had raised from the dust. Surrey had served under Edward IV.
and Richard III.; he had fought against Henry at Bosworth, been
attainted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page050" name="page050"></a>(p. 050)</span>
and sent to the Tower. Reflecting that it was
better to be a Tudor official at Court than a baronial magnate in
prison, he submitted to the King and was set up as a beacon to draw
his peers from their feudal ways. The rest of the council were men of
little distinction. Shrewsbury, the Lord High Steward, was a pale
reflex of Surrey, and illustrious in nought but descent. Charles
Somerset, Lord Herbert, who was Chamberlain and afterwards Earl of
Worcester, was a Beaufort
bastard,<a id="footnotetag93" name="footnotetag93"></a><a href="#footnote93">[93]</a>
and may have derived some
little influence from his harmless kinship with Henry VIII. Lovell,
the Treasurer, Poynings the Controller of the Household, and Harry
Marney, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, were tried and trusty
officials. Bishop Fisher was great as a Churchman, a scholar, a patron
of learning, but not as a man of affairs; while Buckingham, the only
duke in England, and his brother, the Earl of Wiltshire, were rigidly
excluded by dynastic jealousy from all share in political authority.</p>

<p>The most persistent of Henry's advisers was none of his council. He
was Ferdinand the Catholic, King of Aragon; and to his inspiration has
been ascribed<a id="footnotetag94" name="footnotetag94"></a><a href="#footnote94">[94]</a>
the course of foreign policy during the first five
years of his son-in-law's reign. He worked through his daughter; the
only thing she valued in life, wrote Catherine a month after her
marriage, was her father's confidence. When Membrilla was recalled
because he failed to satisfy Catherine's somewhat exacting temper, she
was herself formally
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page051" name="page051"></a>(p. 051)</span>
commissioned to act in his place as
Ferdinand's ambassador at Henry's Court; Henry was begged to give her
implicit credence and communicate with Spain through her mediation!
"These kingdoms of <i>your</i> highness," she wrote to her father, "are in
great
tranquillity."<a id="footnotetag95" name="footnotetag95"></a><a href="#footnote95">[95]</a>
Well might Ferdinand congratulate himself on
the result of her marriage, and the addition of fresh, to his already
extensive, domains. He needed them all to ensure the success of his
far-reaching schemes. His eldest grandson, Charles, was heir not only
to Castile and Aragon, Naples and the Indies, which were to come to
him from his mother, Ferdinand's imbecile daughter, Juaña, but to
Burgundy and Austria, the lands of his father, Philip, and of Philip's
father, the Emperor Maximilian. This did not satisfy Ferdinand's
grasping ambition; he sought to carve out for his second grandson,
named after himself, a kingdom in Northern
Italy.<a id="footnotetag96" name="footnotetag96"></a><a href="#footnote96">[96]</a>
On the Duchy of
Milan, the republics of Venice, Genoa and Florence, his greedy eyes
were fixed. Once conquered, they would bar the path of France to
Naples; compensated by these possessions, the younger Ferdinand might
resign his share in the Austrian inheritance to Charles; while Charles
himself was to marry the only daughter of the King of Hungary, add
that to his other dominions, and revive the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page052" name="page052"></a>(p. 052)</span>
empire of
Charlemagne. Partly with these objects in view, partly to draw off the
scent from his own track, Ferdinand had, in 1508, raised the hue and
cry after Venice. Pope and Emperor, France and Spain, joined in the
chase, but of all the parties to the league of Cambrai, Louis XII. was
in a position to profit the most. His victory over Venice at Agnadello
(14th May, 1509), secured him Milan and Venetian territory as far as
the Mincio; it also dimmed the prospects of Ferdinand's Italian scheme
and threatened his hold on Naples; but the Spanish King was restrained
from open opposition to France by the fact that Louis was still
mediating between him and Maximilian on their claims to the
administration of Castile, the realm of their daughter and
daughter-in-law, Juaña.</p>



<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>Such was the situation with which Henry VIII. and his council were
required to deal. The young King entered the arena of Europe, a child
of generous impulse in a throng of hoary intriguers&mdash;Ferdinand,
Maximilian, Louis XII., Julius II.&mdash;each of whom was nearly three
times his age. He was shocked to see them leagued to spoil a petty
republic, a republic, too, which had been for ages the bulwark of
Christendom against the Turk and from time immemorial the ally of
England. Venice had played no small part in the revival of letters
which appealed so strongly to Henry's intellectual sympathies.
Scholars and physicians from Venice, or from equally threatened
Italian republics, frequented his Court and Cabinet. Venetian
merchants developed the commerce of London; Venetian galleys called
twice a year at Southampton on their way to and from Flanders, and
their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page053" name="page053"></a>(p. 053)</span>
trade was a source of profit to both nations.
Inevitably Henry's sympathies went out to the sore-pressed republic.
They were none the less strong because the chief of the spoilers was
France, for Henry and his people were imbued with an inborn antipathy
to everything
French.<a id="footnotetag97" name="footnotetag97"></a><a href="#footnote97">[97]</a>
Before he came to the throne he was reported
to be France's enemy; and speculations were rife as to the chances of
his invading it and imitating the exploits of his ancestor Henry V. It
needed no persuasion from Ferdinand to induce him to intervene in
favour of Venice. Within a few weeks of his accession he refused to
publish the papal bull which cast the halo of crusaders over the
bandits of Cambrai. The day after his coronation he deplored to Badoer
Louis' victory at Agnadello, and a week later he wrote to the
sovereigns of Europe urging the injustice of their Venetian crusade.
In September he sent Bainbridge, Cardinal-Archbishop of York, to
reside at the Papal Court, and watch over the interests of Venice as
well as of England. "Italy," wrote Badoer, "was entirely rescued from
the barbarians by the movements of the English King; and, but for
that, Ferdinand would have done
nothing."<a id="footnotetag98" name="footnotetag98"></a><a href="#footnote98">[98]</a>
Henry vainly endeavoured
to persuade Maximilian, the Venetian's lifelong foe, to accept
arbitration; but he succeeded in inducing the Doge to make his peace
with the Pope, and Julius to remove his ecclesiastical censures. To
Ferdinand he declared that Venice must be preserved as a wall against
the Turk, and he hinted that Ferdinand's own dominions in Italy would,
if Venice were destroyed, "be unable to resist
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page054" name="page054"></a>(p. 054)</span>
the ambitious
designs of certain Christian
princes".<a id="footnotetag99" name="footnotetag99"></a><a href="#footnote99">[99]</a>
The danger was as patent to
Julius and Ferdinand as it was to Henry; and as soon as Ferdinand had
induced Louis to give a favourable verdict in his suit with the
Emperor, the Catholic King was ready to join Henry and the Pope in a
league of defence.</p>

<p>But, in spite of Venetian, Spanish and papal instigations to "recover
his noble inheritance in France," in spite of his own indignation at
the treatment of Venice, and the orders issued in the first year of
his reign to his subjects to furnish themselves with weapons of war,
for which the long peace had left them
unprepared,<a id="footnotetag100" name="footnotetag100"></a><a href="#footnote100">[100]</a>
Henry, or the
peace party in his council, was unwilling to resort to the arbitrament
of arms. He renewed his father's treaties not only with other powers,
but, much to the disgust of Ferdinand, Venice and the Pope, with Louis
himself. His first martial exploit, apart from 1,500 archers whom he
was bound by treaty to send to aid the Netherlands against the Duke of
Guelders,<a id="footnotetag101" name="footnotetag101"></a><a href="#footnote101">[101]</a>
was an expedition for the destruction of the enemies of
the faith.<a id="footnotetag102" name="footnotetag102"></a><a href="#footnote102">[102]</a>
Such an expedition, he once said, he owed to God for
his peaceful accession; at another time he
declared<a id="footnotetag103" name="footnotetag103"></a><a href="#footnote103">[103]</a>
that he
cherished, like an heirloom, the ardour against the infidel which he
inherited from his father. He repressed that ardour, it must be added,
with as much success as Henry VII.; and apart from this one youthful
indiscretion, he did not suffer his ancestral zeal to escape into
action. His generous illusions soon vanished before the sordid
realities of European statecraft; and the defence of Christendom
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page055" name="page055"></a>(p. 055)</span>
became with him, as with others, a hollow pretence, a diplomatic
fiction, the infinite varieties of which age could not wither nor
custom stale. Did a monarch wish for peace? Peace at once was
imperative to enable Christian princes to combine against the Turk.
Did he desire war? War became a disagreeable necessity to restrain the
ambition of Christian princes who, "worse than the infidel," disturbed
the peace of Christendom and opened a door for the enemies of the
Church. Nor did the success of Henry's first crusade encourage him to
persist in similar efforts. It sailed from Plymouth in May, 1511, to
join in Ferdinand's attack on the Moors, but it had scarcely landed
when bickerings broke out between the Christian allies, and Ferdinand
informed the English commanders that he had made peace with the
Infidel, to gird his loins for war with the Most Christian King.</p>

<p>In the midst of their preparation against infidels, so runs the
preamble to the treaty in which Henry and Ferdinand signified their
adhesion to the Holy League, they heard that Louis was besieging the
Pope in
Bologna.<a id="footnotetag104" name="footnotetag104"></a><a href="#footnote104">[104]</a>
The thought of violent hands being laid on the
Vicar of Christ stirred Henry to a depth of indignation which no
injuries practised against a temporal power could rouse. His ingenuous
deference to the Papacy was in singular contrast to the contempt with
which it was treated by more experienced sovereigns, and they traded
on the weight which Henry always attached to the words of the Pope. He
had read Maximilian grave lectures on his conduct in countenancing the
schismatic <i>conciliabulum</i> assembled by Louis at
Pisa.<a id="footnotetag105" name="footnotetag105"></a><a href="#footnote105">[105]</a>
He wrote
to Bainbridge at the Papal Court that he was ready to sacrifice goods,
life
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page056" name="page056"></a>(p. 056)</span>
and kingdom for the Pope and the
Church;<a id="footnotetag106" name="footnotetag106"></a><a href="#footnote106">[106]</a>
and to
the Emperor that at the beginning of his reign he thought of nothing
else than an expedition against the Infidel. But now he was called by
the Pope and the danger of the Church in another direction; and he
proceeded to denounce the impiety and schism of the French and their
atrocious deeds in Italy. He joined Ferdinand in requiring Louis to
desist from his impious work. Louis turned a deaf ear to their
demands; and in November, 1511, they bound themselves to defend the
Church against all aggression and make war upon the aggressor.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>This reversal of the pacific policy which had marked the first two and
a half years of Henry's reign was not exclusively due to the King's
zeal for the Church. The clerical party of peace in his council was
now divided by the appearance of an ecclesiastic who was far more
remarkable than any of his colleagues, and to whose turbulence and
energy the boldness of English policy must, henceforth, for many years
be mainly ascribed. Thomas Wolsey had been appointed Henry's almoner
at the beginning of his reign, but he exercised no apparent influence
in public affairs. It was not till 1511 that he joined the council,
though during the interval he must have been gradually building up his
ascendancy over the King's mind. To Wolsey, restlessly ambitious for
himself, for Henry, and England, was attributed the responsibility for
the sudden adoption of a spirited foreign policy; and it was in the
preparations for the war of 1512 that his marvellous industry and
grasp of detail first found full scope.</p>

<p>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page057" name="page057"></a>(p. 057)</span>
main attack of the English and Spanish monarchs was to be
on
Guienne,<a id="footnotetag107" name="footnotetag107"></a><a href="#footnote107">[107]</a>
and in May, 1512, Henry went down to Southampton to
speed the departing
fleet.<a id="footnotetag108" name="footnotetag108"></a><a href="#footnote108">[108]</a>
It sailed from Cowes under Dorset's
command on 3rd June, and a week later the army disembarked on the
coast of
Guipuscoa.<a id="footnotetag109" name="footnotetag109"></a><a href="#footnote109">[109]</a>
There it remained throughout the torrid
summer, awaiting the Spanish King's forces to co-operate in the
invasion of France. But Ferdinand was otherwise occupied. Navarre was
not mentioned in the treaty with Henry, but Navarre was what Ferdinand
had in his mind. It was then an independent kingdom, surrounded on
three sides by Spanish territory, and an easy prey which would serve
to unite all Spain beyond the Pyrenees under Ferdinand's rule. Under
pretence of restoring Guienne to the English crown, Dorset's army had
been enticed to Passages, and there it was used as a screen against
the French, behind which Ferdinand calmly proceeded to conquer
Navarre. It was, he said, impossible to march into France with Navarre
unsubdued in his rear. Navarre was at peace, but it might join the
French, and he invited Dorset to help in securing the prey. Dorset
refused to exceed his commission, but the presence of his army at
Passages was admitted by the Spaniards to be "quite
providential,"<a id="footnotetag110" name="footnotetag110"></a><a href="#footnote110">[110]</a>
as it prevented the French from assisting Navarre.
English indignation was loud and deep; men and officers vowed that,
but for Henry's displeasure, they would have called to account the
perfidious King. Condemned to inactivity, the troops almost mutinied;
they found it impossible to live on their wages of sixpence a day
(equivalent now to at least six
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page058" name="page058"></a>(p. 058)</span>
shillings), drank Spanish
wine as if it were English beer, and died of dysentery like flies in
the autumn. Discipline relaxed; drill was neglected. Still Ferdinand
tarried, and in October, seeing no hope of an attempt on Guienne that
year, the army took matters into its own hands and embarked for
England.<a id="footnotetag111" name="footnotetag111"></a><a href="#footnote111">[111]</a></p>

<p>Henry's first military enterprise had ended in disgrace and disaster.
The repute of English soldiers, dimmed by long peace, was now further
tarnished. Henry's own envoys complained of the army's
insubordination, its impatience of the toils, and inexperience of the
feats, of war; and its ignominious return exposed him to the taunts of
both friends and foes. He had been on the point of ordering it home,
when it came of its own accord; but the blow to his authority was not,
on that account, less severe. His irritation was not likely to be
soothed when he realised the extent to which he had been duped by his
father-in-law. Ferdinand was loud in complaints and
excuses.<a id="footnotetag112" name="footnotetag112"></a><a href="#footnote112">[112]</a>
September and October were, he said, the proper months for a campaign
in Guienne, and he was marching to join the English army at the moment
of its desertion. In reality, it had served his purpose to perfection.
Its presence had diverted French levies from Italy, and enabled him,
unmolested, to conquer Navarre. With that he was content. Why should
he wish to see Henry in Guienne? He was too shrewd to involve his own
forces in that hopeless adventure, and the departure of the English
furnished him with an excuse for entering into secret negotiations
with Louis. His
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page059" name="page059"></a>(p. 059)</span>
methods were eloquent of sixteenth-century
diplomacy. He was, he ordered Carroz to tell Henry many months
later,<a id="footnotetag113" name="footnotetag113"></a><a href="#footnote113">[113]</a>
when concealment was no longer possible or necessary,
sending a holy friar to his daughter in England; the friar's health
did not permit of his going by sea; so he went through France, and was
taken prisoner. Hearing of his fame for piety, the French Queen
desired his ghostly advice, and took the opportunity of the interview
to persuade the friar to return to Spain with proposals of peace.
Ferdinand was suddenly convinced that death was at hand; his confessor
exhorted him to forgive and make peace with his enemies. This work of
piety he could not in conscience neglect. So he agreed to a
twelvemonth's truce, which secured Navarre. In spite of his conscience
he would never have consented, had he not felt that the truce was
really in Henry's interests. But what weighed with him most was, he
said, the reformation of the Church. That should be Henry's first and
noblest work; he could render no greater service to God. No
reformation was possible without peace, and so long as the Church was
unreformed, wars among princes would never cease.</p>

<p>Such reasoning, he thought, would appeal to the pious and
unsophisticated Henry. To other sovereigns he used arguments more
suited to their experience of his diplomacy. He told
Maximilian<a id="footnotetag114" name="footnotetag114"></a><a href="#footnote114">[114]</a>
that his main desire was to serve the Emperor's interests, to put a
curb on the Italians, and to frustrate their design of driving
himself, Louis and Maximilian across the Alps. But the most monumental
falsehood he reserved for the Pope; his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page060" name="page060"></a>(p. 060)</span>
ambassador at the
Papal Court was to assure Julius that he had failed in his efforts to
concert with Henry a joint invasion of France, that Henry was not in
earnest over the war and that he had actually made a
truce<a id="footnotetag115" name="footnotetag115"></a><a href="#footnote115">[115]</a>
with
France. This had enabled Louis to pour fresh troops into Italy, and
compelled him, Ferdinand, to consult his own interests and make peace!
Two days later he was complaining to Louis that Henry refused to join
in the
truce.<a id="footnotetag116" name="footnotetag116"></a><a href="#footnote116">[116]</a>
To punish Henry for his refusal he was willing to
aid Louis against him, but he would prefer to settle the differences
between the French and the English kings by a still more treacherous
expedient. Julius was to be induced to give a written promise that, if
the points at issue were submitted to his arbitration, he would
pronounce no verdict till it had been secretly sanctioned by Ferdinand
and Louis. This promise obtained, Louis was publicly to appeal to the
Pope; Henry's devotion to the Church would prevent his refusing the
Supreme Pontiff's mediation; if he did, ecclesiastical censures could
be invoked against
him.<a id="footnotetag117" name="footnotetag117"></a><a href="#footnote117">[117]</a>
Such was the plot Ferdinand was hatching
for the benefit of his daughter's husband. The Catholic King had ever
deceit in his heart and the name of God on his lips. He was accused by
a rival of having cheated him twice; the charge was repeated to
Ferdinand. "He lies," he broke out, "I cheated him three times." He
was faithful to one principle only, self-aggrandisement by fair means
or foul. His favourite scheme was a kingdom in Northern Italy; but in
the way of its realisation his own overreaching ambition placed an
insuperable bar. Italy had been excluded from his truce with France to
leave him free
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page061" name="page061"></a>(p. 061)</span>
to pursue that
design;<a id="footnotetag118" name="footnotetag118"></a><a href="#footnote118">[118]</a>
but in July,
1512, the Italians already suspected his motives, and a papal legate
declared that they no more wished to see Milan Spanish than
French.<a id="footnotetag119" name="footnotetag119"></a><a href="#footnote119">[119]</a>
In the following November, Spanish troops in the pay and
alliance of Venice drove the French out of Brescia. By the terms of
the Holy League, it should have been restored to its owner, the
Venetian Republic. Ferdinand kept it himself; it was to form the
nucleus of his North Italian dominion. Venice at once took alarm and
made a compact with France which kept the Spaniards at bay until after
Ferdinand's
death.<a id="footnotetag120" name="footnotetag120"></a><a href="#footnote120">[120]</a>
The friendship between Venice and France
severed that between France and the Emperor; and, in 1513, the war
went on with a rearrangement of partners, Henry and Maximilian on one
side,<a id="footnotetag121" name="footnotetag121"></a><a href="#footnote121">[121]</a>
against France and Venice on the other, with Ferdinand
secretly trying to trick them all.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>For many months Henry knew not, or refused to credit, his
father-in-law's perfidy. To outward appearance, the Spanish King was
as eager as ever for the war in Guienne. He was urging Henry to levy
6,000 Germans
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page062" name="page062"></a>(p. 062)</span>
to serve for that purpose in conjunction with
Spanish forces; and, in April, Carroz, in ignorance of his master's
real intentions, signed on his behalf a treaty for the joint invasion
of France.<a id="footnotetag122" name="footnotetag122"></a><a href="#footnote122">[122]</a>
This forced the Catholic King to reveal his hand. He
refused his
ratification;<a id="footnotetag123" name="footnotetag123"></a><a href="#footnote123">[123]</a>
now he declared the conquest of Guienne
to be a task of such magnitude that preparations must be complete
before April, a date already past; and he recommended Henry to come
into the truce with Louis, the existence of which he had now to
confess. Henry had not yet fathomed the depths; he even appealed to
Ferdinand's feelings and pathetically besought him, as a good father,
not to forsake him
entirely.<a id="footnotetag124" name="footnotetag124"></a><a href="#footnote124">[124]</a>
But in vain; his father-in-law
deserted him at his sorest hour of need. To make peace was out of the
question. England's honour had suffered a stain that must at all costs
be removed. No king with an atom of spirit would let the dawn of his
reign be clouded by such an admission of failure. Wolsey was there to
stiffen his temper in case of need; with him it was almost a matter of
life and death to retrieve the disaster. His credit was pledged in the
war. In their moments of anger under the Spanish sun, the English
commanders had loudly imputed to Wolsey the origin of the war and the
cause of all the
mischief.<a id="footnotetag125" name="footnotetag125"></a><a href="#footnote125">[125]</a>
Surrey, for whose banishment from
Court the new favourite had expressed to Fox a wish, and other "great
men" at home, repeated the
charge.<a id="footnotetag126" name="footnotetag126"></a><a href="#footnote126">[126]</a>
Had Wolsey failed to bring
honour with peace, his name would not have been numbered among the
greatest of England's statesmen.</p>

<p>Henry's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page063" name="page063"></a>(p. 063)</span>
temper required no spur. Tudors never flinched in the
face of danger, and nothing could have made Henry so resolved to go on
as Ferdinand's desertion and advice to desist. He was prepared to
avenge his army in person. There were to be no expeditions to distant
shores; there was to be war in the Channel, where Englishmen were at
home on the sea; and Calais was to be the base of an invasion of
France over soil worn by the tramp of English troops. In March, 1513,
Henry, to whom the navy was a weapon, a plaything, a passion, watched
his fleet sail down the Thames; its further progress was told him in
letters from its gallant admiral, Sir Edmund Howard, who had been
strictly charged to inform the King of the minutest details in the
behaviour of every one of the
ships.<a id="footnotetag127" name="footnotetag127"></a><a href="#footnote127">[127]</a>
Never had such a display of
naval force left the English shores; twenty-four ships ranging
downwards from the 1,600 tons of the <i>Henry Imperial</i>, bore nearly
5,000 marines and 3,000
mariners.<a id="footnotetag128" name="footnotetag128"></a><a href="#footnote128">[128]</a>
The French dared not venture
out, while Howard swept the Channel, and sought them in their ports.
Brest was blockaded. A squadron of Mediterranean galleys coming to its
relief anchored in the shallow water off Conquêt. Howard determined to
cut them out; he grappled and boarded their admiral's galley. The
grappling was cut away, his boat swept out in the tide, and Howard,
left unsupported, was thrust overboard by the Frenchmen's
pikes.<a id="footnotetag129" name="footnotetag129"></a><a href="#footnote129">[129]</a>
His death was regarded as a national disaster, but he had retrieved
England's reputation for foolhardy valour.</p>

<p>Meanwhile,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page064" name="page064"></a>(p. 064)</span>
Henry's army was gathering at
Calais.<a id="footnotetag130" name="footnotetag130"></a><a href="#footnote130">[130]</a>
On 30th
June, at 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, the King himself landed. Before his departure, the
unfortunate Edmund de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, was brought to the
block for an alleged correspondence with his brother in Louis'
service, but really because rumours were rife of Louis' intention to
proclaim the White Rose as King of
England.<a id="footnotetag131" name="footnotetag131"></a><a href="#footnote131">[131]</a>
On 21st July, Henry
left Calais to join his army, which had already advanced into French
territory. Heavy rains impeded its march and added to its discomfort.
Henry, we are told, did not put off his clothes, but rode round the
camp at three in the morning, cheering his men with the remark, "Well,
comrades, now that we have suffered in the beginning, fortune promises
us better things, God
willing".<a id="footnotetag132" name="footnotetag132"></a><a href="#footnote132">[132]</a>
Near Ardres some German
mercenaries, of whom there were 8,000 with Henry's forces, pillaged
the church; Henry promptly had three of them hanged. On 1st August the
army sat down before Thérouanne; on the 10th, the Emperor arrived to
serve as a private at a hundred crowns a day under the English
banners. Three days later a large French force arrived at Guinegate to
raise the siege; a panic seized it, and the bloodless rout that
followed was named the Battle of Spurs. Louis d'Orléans, Duc de
Longueville, the famous Chevalier Bayard, and others of the noblest
blood in France, were among the
captives.<a id="footnotetag133" name="footnotetag133"></a><a href="#footnote133">[133]</a>
Ten days after this
defeat
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page065" name="page065"></a>(p. 065)</span>
Thérouanne surrendered; and on the 24th Henry made
his triumphal entry into the first town captured by English arms since
the days of Jeanne Darc. On the 26th he removed to Guinegate, where he
remained a week, "according," says a curious document, "to the laws of
arms, for in case any man would bid battle for the besieging and
getting of any city or town, then the winner (has) to give battle, and
to abide the same certain
days".<a id="footnotetag134" name="footnotetag134"></a><a href="#footnote134">[134]</a>
No challenge was forthcoming,
and on 15th September Henry besieged Tournay, then said to be the
richest city north of Paris. During the progress of the siege the Lady
Margaret of Savoy, the Regent of the Netherlands, joined her father,
the Emperor, and Henry, at Lille. They discussed plans for renewing
the war next year and for the marriage of Charles and Mary. To please
the Lady Margaret and to exhibit his skill Henry played the gitteron,
the lute and the cornet, and danced and jousted before
her.<a id="footnotetag135" name="footnotetag135"></a><a href="#footnote135">[135]</a>
He
"excelled every one as much in agility in breaking spears as in
nobleness of stature". Within a week Tournay fell; on 13th October
Henry commenced his return, and on the 21st he re-embarked at Calais.</p>

<p>Thérouanne, the Battle of Spurs, and Tournay were not the only, or the
most striking, successes in this year of war. In July, Catherine, whom
Henry had left as Regent in England, wrote that she was "horribly busy
with making standards, banners, and
badges"<a id="footnotetag136" name="footnotetag136"></a><a href="#footnote136">[136]</a>
for the army in the
North; for war with France had brought, as usual, the Scots upon the
English backs. James IV., though Henry's brother-in-law, preferred to
be the cat's paw of the King of France; and in August the Scots
forces
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page066" name="page066"></a>(p. 066)</span>
poured over the Border under the command of James
himself. England was prepared; and on 9th September, "at Flodden
hills," sang Skelton, "our bows and bills slew all the flower of their
honour". James IV. was left a mutilated corpse upon the field of
battle.<a id="footnotetag137" name="footnotetag137"></a><a href="#footnote137">[137]</a>
"He has paid," wrote Henry, "a heavier penalty for his
perfidy than we would have wished." There was some justice in the
charge. James was bound by treaty not to go to war with England; he
had not even waited for the Pope's answer to his request for
absolution from his oath; and his challenge to Henry, when he was in
France and could not meet it, was not a knightly deed. Henry wrote to
Leo for permission to bury the excommunicated Scottish King with royal
honours in St.
Paul's.<a id="footnotetag138" name="footnotetag138"></a><a href="#footnote138">[138]</a>
The permission was granted, but the
interment did not take place. In Italy, Louis fared no better; at
Novara, on 6th June, the Swiss infantry broke in pieces the grand army
of France, drove the fragments across the Alps, and restored the Duchy
of Milan to the native house of Sforza.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>The results of the campaign of 1513 were a striking vindication of the
refusal of Henry VIII. and Wolsey to rest under the stigma of their
Spanish expedition of 1512. English prestige was not only restored,
but raised higher than it had stood since the death of Henry V., whose
"name," said Pasqualigo, a Venetian in London, "Henry VIII. would now
renew". He styled him "our great
King".<a id="footnotetag139" name="footnotetag139"></a><a href="#footnote139">[139]</a>
Peter Martyr, a resident
at Ferdinand's Court, declared
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page067" name="page067"></a>(p. 067)</span>
that the Spanish King was
"afraid of the over-growing power of
England".<a id="footnotetag140" name="footnotetag140"></a><a href="#footnote140">[140]</a>
Another Venetian
in London reported that "were Henry ambitious of dominion like others,
he would soon give law to the world". But, he added, "he is good and
has a good council. His quarrel was a just one, he marched to free the
Church, to obtain his own, and to liberate Italy from the
French."<a id="footnotetag141" name="footnotetag141"></a><a href="#footnote141">[141]</a>
The pomp and parade of Henry's wars have, indeed,
somewhat obscured the fundamentally pacific character of his reign.
The correspondence of the time bears constant witness to the peaceful
tendencies of Henry and his council. "I content myself," he once said
to Giustinian, "with my own, I only wish to command my own subjects;
but, on the other hand, I do not choose that any one shall have it in
his power to command
me."<a id="footnotetag142" name="footnotetag142"></a><a href="#footnote142">[142]</a>
On another occasion he said: "We want
all potentates to content themselves with their own territories; we
are content with this island of ours"; and Giustinian, after four
years' residence at Henry's Court, gave it as his deliberate opinion
to his Government, that Henry did not covet his neighbours' goods, was
satisfied with his own dominions, and "extremely desirous of
peace".<a id="footnotetag143" name="footnotetag143"></a><a href="#footnote143">[143]</a>
Ferdinand said, in 1513, that his pensions from France
and a free hand in Scotland were all that Henry really
desired;<a id="footnotetag144" name="footnotetag144"></a><a href="#footnote144">[144]</a>
and Carroz, his ambassador, reported that Henry's councillors did not
like to be at war with any
one.<a id="footnotetag145" name="footnotetag145"></a><a href="#footnote145">[145]</a>
Peace, they told Badoer, suited
England better than
war.<a id="footnotetag146" name="footnotetag146"></a><a href="#footnote146">[146]</a></p>

<p>But
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page068" name="page068"></a>(p. 068)</span>
Henry's actions proclaimed louder than the words of
himself or of others that he believed peace to be the first of English
interests. He waged no wars on the continent except against France;
and though he reigned thirty-eight years, his hostilities with France
were compressed into as many months. The campaigns of 1512-13,
Surrey's and Suffolk's inroads of 1522 and 1523, and Henry's invasion
of 1544, represent the sum of his military operations outside Great
Britain and Ireland. He acquired Tournay in 1513 and Boulogne in 1544,
but the one was restored in five years for an indemnity, and the other
was to be given back in eight for a similar consideration. These facts
are in curious contrast with the high-sounding schemes of recovering
the crown of France, which others were always suggesting to Henry, and
which he, for merely conventional reasons, was in the habit of
enunciating before going to war; and in view of the tenacity which
Henry exhibited in other respects, and the readiness with which he
relinquished his regal pretensions to France, it is difficult to
believe that they were any real expression of settled policy. They
were, indeed, impossible of achievement, and Henry saw the fact
clearly
enough.<a id="footnotetag147" name="footnotetag147"></a><a href="#footnote147">[147]</a>
Modern phenomena such as huge armies sweeping
over Europe, and capitals from Berlin to Moscow, Paris to Madrid,
falling before them, were quite beyond military science of the
sixteenth century. Armies fought, as a rule, only in the five summer
months; it was difficult enough to victual them for even that time;
and lack of commissariat or transport crippled all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page069" name="page069"></a>(p. 069)</span>
the
invasions of Scotland. Hertford sacked Edinburgh, but he went by sea.
No other capital except Rome saw an invading army. Neither Henry nor
Maximilian, Ferdinand nor Charles, ever penetrated more than a few
miles into France, and French armies got no further into Spain, the
Netherlands, or Germany. Machiavelli points out that the chief
safeguard of France against the Spaniards was that the latter could
not victual their army sufficiently to pass the
Pyrenees.<a id="footnotetag148" name="footnotetag148"></a><a href="#footnote148">[148]</a>
If in
Italy it was different, it was because Italy herself invited the
invaders, and was mainly under foreign dominion. Henry knew that with
the means at his disposal he could never conquer France; his claims to
the crown were transparent conventions, and he was always ready for
peace in return for the <i>status quo</i> and a money indemnity, with a
town or so for security.</p>

<p>The fact that he had only achieved a small part of the conquest he
professed to set out to accomplish was, therefore, no bar to
negotiations for peace. There were many reasons for ending the war;
the rapid diminution of his father's treasures; the accession to the
papal throne of the pacific Leo in place of the warlike Julius; the
absolution of Louis as a reward for renouncing the council of Pisa;
the interruption of the trade with Venice; the attention required by
Scotland now that her king was Henry's infant nephew; and lastly, his
betrayal first by Ferdinand and now by the Emperor. In October, 1513,
at Lille, a treaty had been drawn up binding Henry, Maximilian and
Ferdinand to a combined invasion of France before the following
June.<a id="footnotetag149" name="footnotetag149"></a><a href="#footnote149">[149]</a>
On 6th December, Ferdinand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page070" name="page070"></a>(p. 070)</span>
wrote to Henry to say
he had signed the treaty. He pointed out the sacrifices he was making
in so doing; he was induced to make them by considering that the war
was to be waged in the interests of the Holy Church, of Maximilian,
Henry, and Catherine, and by his wish and hope to live and die in
friendship with the Emperor and the King of England. He thought,
however, that to make sure of the assistance of God, the allies ought
to bind themselves, if He gave them the victory, to undertake a
general war on the
infidel.<a id="footnotetag150" name="footnotetag150"></a><a href="#footnote150">[150]</a>
Ferdinand seems to have imagined that
he could dupe the Almighty as easily as he hoped to cheat his allies,
by a pledge which he never meant to fulfil. A fortnight after this
despatch he ordered Carroz not to ratify the treaty he himself had
already
signed.<a id="footnotetag151" name="footnotetag151"></a><a href="#footnote151">[151]</a>
The reason was not far to seek. He was deluding
himself with the hope, which Louis shrewdly encouraged, that the
French King would, after his recent reverses, fall in with the
Spaniard's Italian
plans.<a id="footnotetag152" name="footnotetag152"></a><a href="#footnote152">[152]</a>
Louis might even, he thought, of his
own accord cede Milan and Genoa, which would annihilate the French
King's influence in Italy, and greatly facilitate the attack on
Venice.</p>

<p>That design had occupied him throughout the summer, before Louis had
become so amenable; then he was urging Maximilian that the Pope must
be kept on their side and persuaded "not to forgive the great sins
committed by the King of France"; for if he removed his ecclesiastical
censures, Ferdinand and Maximilian "would be deprived of a plausible
excuse for confiscating the territories they intended to
conquer".<a id="footnotetag153" name="footnotetag153"></a><a href="#footnote153">[153]</a>
Providence was, as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page071" name="page071"></a>(p. 071)</span>
usual, to be bribed into
assisting in the robbery of Venice by a promise to make war on the
Turk. But now that Louis was prepared to give his daughter Renée in
marriage to young Ferdinand and to endow the couple with Milan and
Genoa and his claims on Naples, his sins might be forgiven. The two
monarchs would not be justified in making war upon France in face of
these offers. Venice remained a difficulty, for Louis was not likely
to help to despoil his faithful ally; but Ferdinand had a suggestion.
They could all make peace publicly guaranteeing the Republic's
possessions, but Maximilian and he could make a "mental reservation"
enabling them to partition Venice, when France could no longer prevent
it.<a id="footnotetag154" name="footnotetag154"></a><a href="#footnote154">[154]</a></p>

<p>So on 13th March, 1514, Ferdinand renewed his truce with France, and
Maximilian joined it soon
after.<a id="footnotetag155" name="footnotetag155"></a><a href="#footnote155">[155]</a>
The old excuses about the
reformation of the Church, his death-bed desire to make peace with his
enemies, could scarcely be used again; so Ferdinand instructed his
agent to say, if Henry asked for an explanation, that there was a
secret conspiracy in
Italy.<a id="footnotetag156" name="footnotetag156"></a><a href="#footnote156">[156]</a>
If he had said no more, it would have
been literally true, for the conspiracy was his own; but he went on to
relate that the conspiracy was being hatched by the Italians to drive
him and the Emperor out of the peninsula. The two were alike in their
treachery; both secretly entered the truce with France and broke their
promise to Henry. Another engagement of longer standing was ruptured.
Since 1508, Henry's sister Mary had been betrothed to Maximilian's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page072" name="page072"></a>(p. 072)</span>
grandson Charles. The marriage was to take place when Charles
was fourteen; the pledge had been renewed at Lille, and the nuptials
fixed not later than 15th May,
1514.<a id="footnotetag157" name="footnotetag157"></a><a href="#footnote157">[157]</a>
Charles wrote to Mary
signing himself <i>votre mari</i>, while Mary was styled Princess of
Castile, carried about a bad portrait of
Charles,<a id="footnotetag158" name="footnotetag158"></a><a href="#footnote158">[158]</a>
and
diplomatically sighed for his presence ten times a day. But winter
wore on and turned to spring; no sign was forthcoming of Maximilian's
intention to keep his grandson's engagement, and Charles was reported
as having said that he wanted a wife and not a
mother.<a id="footnotetag159" name="footnotetag159"></a><a href="#footnote159">[159]</a>
All
Henry's inquiries were met by excuses; the Ides of May came and went,
but they brought no wedding between Mary and Charles.</p>

<p>Henry was learning by bitter experience. Not only was he left to face
single-handed the might of Louis; but Ferdinand and Maximilian had
secretly bound themselves to make war on him, if he carried out the
treaty to which they had all three publicly agreed. The man whom he
said he loved as a natural father, and the titular sovereign of
Christendom, had combined to cheat the boy-king who had come to the
throne with youthful enthusiasms and natural, generous instincts. "Nor
do I see," said Henry to Giustinian, "any faith in the world save in
me, and therefore God Almighty, who knows this, prospers my
affairs."<a id="footnotetag160" name="footnotetag160"></a><a href="#footnote160">[160]</a>
This absorbing belief in himself and his righteousness
led to strange aberrations in later years, but in 1514 it had some
justification. "Je vous assure,"
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page073" name="page073"></a>(p. 073)</span>
wrote Margaret of Savoy to
her father, the Emperor, "qu'en lui n'a nulle faintise." "At any
rate," said Pasqualigo, "King Henry has done himself great honour, and
kept faith
single-handed."<a id="footnotetag161" name="footnotetag161"></a><a href="#footnote161">[161]</a>
A more striking testimony was
forthcoming a year or two later. When Charles succeeded Ferdinand, the
Bishop of Badajos drew up for Cardinal Ximenes a report on the state
of the Prince's affairs. In it he says: "The King of England has been
truer to his engagements towards the House of Austria than any other
prince. The marriage of the Prince with the Princess Mary, it must be
confessed, did not take place, but it may be questioned whether it was
the fault of the King of England or of the Prince and his advisers.
However that may be, with the exception of the marriage, the King of
England has generally fulfilled his obligations towards the Prince,
and has behaved as a trusty friend. An alliance with the English can
be trusted most of
all."<a id="footnotetag162" name="footnotetag162"></a><a href="#footnote162">[162]</a></p>

<p>But the meekest and saintliest monarch could scarce pass unscathed
through the baptism of fraud practised on Henry; and Henry was at no
time saintly or meek. Ferdinand, he complained, induced him to enter
upon the war, and urged the Pope to use his influence with him for
that purpose; he had been at great expense, had assisted Maximilian,
taken Tournay, and reduced France to extremities; and now, when his
enemy was at his feet, Ferdinand talked of truce: he would never trust
any one
again.<a id="footnotetag163" name="footnotetag163"></a><a href="#footnote163">[163]</a>
"Had the King of Spain," wrote a Venetian attaché,
"kept his promise to the King of England, the latter would never have
made peace with France; and the promises of the Emperor were equally
false,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page074" name="page074"></a>(p. 074)</span>
for he had received many thousands of pounds from
King Henry, on condition that he was to be in person at Calais in the
month of May, with a considerable force in the King's pay; but the
Emperor pocketed the money and never came. His failure was the cause
of all that took place, for, as King Henry was deceived in every
direction, he thought fit to take this other
course."<a id="footnotetag164" name="footnotetag164"></a><a href="#footnote164">[164]</a>
He
discovered that he, too, could play at the game of making peace behind
the backs of his nominal friends; and when once he had made up his
mind, he played the game with vastly more effect than Maximilian or
Ferdinand. It was he who had been really formidable to Louis, and
Louis was therefore prepared to pay him a higher price than to either
of the others. In February Henry had got wind of his allies' practices
with France. In the same month a nuncio started from Rome to mediate
peace between Henry and
Louis;<a id="footnotetag165" name="footnotetag165"></a><a href="#footnote165">[165]</a>
but, before his arrival, informal
advances had probably been made through the Duc de Longueville, a
prisoner in England since the Battle of
Spurs.<a id="footnotetag166" name="footnotetag166"></a><a href="#footnote166">[166]</a>
In January Louis'
wife, Anne of Brittany, had died. Louis was fifty-two years old, worn
out and decrepit; but at least half a dozen brides were proposed for
his hand. In March it was rumoured in Rome that he would choose
Henry's sister Mary, the rejected of
Charles.<a id="footnotetag167" name="footnotetag167"></a><a href="#footnote167">[167]</a>
But Henry waited
till May had passed, and Maximilian had proclaimed to the world his
breach of promise. Negotiations for the alliance and marriage with
Louis then proceeded apace. Treaties for both were signed in August.
Tournay remained in Henry's hands, Louis increased the pensions paid
by France
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page075" name="page075"></a>(p. 075)</span>
to England since the Treaty of Étaples, and both
kings bound themselves to render mutual aid against their common
foes.<a id="footnotetag168" name="footnotetag168"></a><a href="#footnote168">[168]</a></p>

<p>Maximilian and Ferdinand were left out in the cold. Louis not only
broke off his negotiations with them, but prepared to regain Milan and
discussed with Henry the revival of his father's schemes for the
conquest of Castile. Henry was to claim part of that kingdom in right
of his wife, the late Queen's daughter; later on a still more shadowy
title by descent was suggested. As early as 5th October, the Venetian
Government wrote to its ambassador in France, "commending extremely
the most sage proceeding of Louis in exhorting the King of England to
attack
Castile".<a id="footnotetag169" name="footnotetag169"></a><a href="#footnote169">[169]</a>
Towards the end of the year it declared that
Louis had wished to attack Spain, and sought to arrange details in an
interview with Henry; but the English King would not consent, delayed
the interview, and refused the six thousand infantry required for the
purpose.<a id="footnotetag170" name="footnotetag170"></a><a href="#footnote170">[170]</a>
But Henry had certainly urged Louis to reconquer
Navarre,<a id="footnotetag171" name="footnotetag171"></a><a href="#footnote171">[171]</a>
and from the tenor of Louis' reply to Henry, late in
November, it would be inferred that the proposed conquest of Castile
also emanated from the English King or his ministers. Louis professed
not to know the laws of succession in Spain, but he was willing to
join the attack, apart from the merits of the case on which it was
based. Whether the suggestion originated in France or in England,
whether Henry eventually refused it or not, its serious discussion
shows how far Henry had travelled in his resentment at the double
dealing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page076" name="page076"></a>(p. 076)</span>
of Ferdinand. Carroz complained that he was treated
by the English "like a bull at whom every one throws
darts,"<a id="footnotetag172" name="footnotetag172"></a><a href="#footnote172">[172]</a>
and
that Henry himself behaved in a most offensive manner whenever
Ferdinand's name was mentioned. "If," he added, "Ferdinand did not put
a bridle on this young colt," it would afterwards become impossible to
control him. The young colt was, indeed, already meditating a project,
to attain which he, in later years, took the bit in his teeth and
broke loose from control. He was not only betrayed into casting in
Catherine's teeth her father's ill faith, but threatening her with
divorce.<a id="footnotetag173" name="footnotetag173"></a><a href="#footnote173">[173]</a></p>

<p>Henry had struck back with a vengeance. His blow shivered to fragments
the airy castles which Maximilian and Ferdinand were busy
constructing. Their plans for reviving the empire of Charlemagne,
creating a new kingdom in Italy, inducing Louis to cede Milan and
Genoa and assist in the conquest of Venice, disappeared like empty
dreams. The younger Ferdinand found no provision in Italy; he was
compelled to retain his Austrian inheritance, and thus to impair the
power of the future Charles V.; while the children's grandparents were
left sadly reflecting on means of defence against the Kings of England
and France. The blot on the triumph was Henry's desertion of
Sforza,<a id="footnotetag174" name="footnotetag174"></a><a href="#footnote174">[174]</a>
who, having gratefully acknowledged that to Henry he owed
his restoration of
Milan,<a id="footnotetag175" name="footnotetag175"></a><a href="#footnote175">[175]</a>
was now left to the uncovenanted
mercies of Louis.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page077" name="page077"></a>(p. 077)</span>
But neither the credit nor discredit is
due mainly to Henry. He had learnt much, but his powers were not yet
developed enough to make him a match for the craft and guile of his
rivals. The consciousness of the fact made him rely more and more upon
Wolsey, who could easily beat both Maximilian and Ferdinand at their
own game. He was not more deceitful than they, but in grasp of detail,
in boldness and assiduity, he was vastly superior. While Ferdinand
hawked, and Maximilian hunted the chamois, Wolsey worked often for
twelve hours together at the cares of the State. Possibly, too, his
clerical profession and the cardinalate which he was soon to hold gave
him an advantage which they did not possess; for, whenever he wanted
to obtain credence for a more than usually monstrous perversion of
truth, he swore "as became a cardinal and on the honour of the
cardinalate".<a id="footnotetag176" name="footnotetag176"></a><a href="#footnote176">[176]</a>
His services were richly rewarded; besides livings,
prebends, deaneries and the Chancellorship of Cambridge University, he
received the Bishoprics of Lincoln and of Tournay, the Archbishopric
of York, and finally, in 1515, Cardinalate. This dignity he had
already, in May of the previous year, sent Polydore Vergil to claim
from the Pope; Vergil's mission was unknown to Henry, to whom the
grant of the Cardinal's hat was to be represented as Leo's own
idea.<a id="footnotetag177" name="footnotetag177"></a><a href="#footnote177">[177]</a></p>





<h3>CHAPTER IV.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page078" name="page078"></a>(p. 078)</span></h3>

<h4>THE THREE RIVALS.</h4>


<p>The edifice which Wolsey had so laboriously built up was, however,
based on no surer foundation than the feeble life of a sickly monarch
already tottering to his grave. In the midst of his preparations for
the conquest of Milan and his negotiations for an attack upon Spain,
Louis XII. died on 1st January, 1515; and the stone which Wolsey had
barely rolled up the hill came down with a rush. The bourgeois Louis
was succeeded by the brilliant, ambitious and warlike Francis I., a
monarch who concealed under the mask of chivalry and the culture of
arts and letters a libertinism beside which the peccadilloes of Henry
or Charles seem virtue itself; whose person was tall and whose
features were described as handsome; but of whom an observer wrote
with unwonted candour that he "looked like the
Devil".<a id="footnotetag178" name="footnotetag178"></a><a href="#footnote178">[178]</a>
The first
result of the change was an episode of genuine romance. The old King's
widow, "la reine blanche," was one of the most fascinating women of
the Tudor epoch. "I think," said a Fleming, "never man saw a more
beautiful creature, nor one having so much grace and
sweetness."<a id="footnotetag179" name="footnotetag179"></a><a href="#footnote179">[179]</a>
"He had never seen so beautiful a lady," repeated Maximilian's
ambassador, "her deportment is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page079" name="page079"></a>(p. 079)</span>
exquisite, both in
conversation and in dancing, and she is very
lovely."<a id="footnotetag180" name="footnotetag180"></a><a href="#footnote180">[180]</a>
"She is
very beautiful," echoed the staid old Venetian, Pasqualigo, "and has
not her match in England; she is tall, fair, of a light complexion
with a colour, and most affable and graceful"; he was warranted, he
said, in describing her as "a nymph from
heaven".<a id="footnotetag181" name="footnotetag181"></a><a href="#footnote181">[181]</a>
A more critical
observer of feminine beauty thought her eyes and eyebrows too
light,<a id="footnotetag182" name="footnotetag182"></a><a href="#footnote182">[182]</a>
but, as an Italian, he may have been biassed in favour of
brunettes, and even he wound up by calling Mary "a Paradise". She was
eighteen at the time; her marriage with a dotard like Louis had
shocked public
opinion;<a id="footnotetag183" name="footnotetag183"></a><a href="#footnote183">[183]</a>
and if, as was hinted, the gaieties in
which his youthful bride involved him, hastened the French King's end,
there was some poetic justice in the retribution. She had, as she
reminded Henry herself, only consented to marry the "very aged and
sickly" monarch on condition that, if she survived him, she should be
allowed to choose her second husband herself. And she went on to
declare, that "remembering the great virtue" in him, she had, as Henry
himself was aware, "always been of good mind to my Lord of
Suffolk".<a id="footnotetag184" name="footnotetag184"></a><a href="#footnote184">[184]</a></p>

<p>She was probably fascinated less by Suffolk's virtue than by his bold
and handsome bearing. A bluff Englishman after the King's own heart,
he shared, as none else did, in Henry's love of the joust and tourney,
in his skill with the lance and the sword; he was the Hector of
combat, on foot and on horse, to Henry's Achilles. His father, plain
William Brandon, was Henry of Richmond's standard-bearer on Bosworth
field; and as such he had been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page080" name="page080"></a>(p. 080)</span>
singled out and killed in
personal encounter by Richard III. His death gave his son a claim on
the gratitude of Henry VII. and Henry VIII.; and similarity of tastes
secured him rapid promotion at the young King's Court. Created
Viscount Lisle, he served in 1513 as marshal of Henry's army
throughout his campaign in France. With the King there were said to be
"two obstinate men who governed
everything";<a id="footnotetag185" name="footnotetag185"></a><a href="#footnote185">[185]</a>
one was Wolsey, the
other was Brandon. In July he was offering his hand to Margaret of
Savoy, who was informed that Brandon was "a second king," and that it
would be well to write him "a kind letter, for it is he who does and
undoes".<a id="footnotetag186" name="footnotetag186"></a><a href="#footnote186">[186]</a>
At Lille, in October, he continued his assault on
Margaret as a relief from the siege of Tournay; Henry favoured his
suit, and when Margaret called Brandon a <i>larron</i> for stealing a ring
from her finger, the King was called in to help Brandon out with his
French. Possibly it was to smooth the course of his wooing that
Brandon, early in 1514, received an extraordinary advancement in rank.
There was as yet only one duke in England, but now Brandon was made
Duke of Suffolk, at the same time that the dukedom of Norfolk was
restored to Surrey for his victory at Flodden. Even a dukedom could
barely make the son of a simple esquire a match for an emperor's
daughter, and the suit did not prosper. Political reasons may have
interfered. Suffolk, too, is accused by the Venetian ambassador of
having already had three
wives.<a id="footnotetag187" name="footnotetag187"></a><a href="#footnote187">[187]</a>
This seems to be an exaggeration,
but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page081" name="page081"></a>(p. 081)</span>
the intricacy of the Duke's marital relationships, and
the facility with which he renounced them might well have served as a
precedent to his master in later years.</p>

<p>In January, 1515, the Duke was sent to Paris to condole with Francis
on Louis' death, to congratulate him on his own accession, and renew
the league with England. Before he set out, Henry made him promise
that he would not marry Mary until their return. But Suffolk was not
the man to resist the tears of a beautiful woman in trouble, and he
found Mary in sore distress. No sooner was Louis dead than his
lascivious successor became, as Mary said, "importunate with her in
divers matters not to her honour," in suits "the which," wrote
Suffolk, "I and the Queen had rather be out of the world than
abide".<a id="footnotetag188" name="footnotetag188"></a><a href="#footnote188">[188]</a>
Every evening Francis forced his attentions upon the
beautiful
widow.<a id="footnotetag189" name="footnotetag189"></a><a href="#footnote189">[189]</a>
Nor was this the only trouble which threatened
the lovers. There were reports that the French would not let Mary go,
but marry her somewhere to serve their own political
purposes.<a id="footnotetag190" name="footnotetag190"></a><a href="#footnote190">[190]</a>
Henry, too, might want to betroth her again to Charles; Maximilian was
urging this course, and telling Margaret that Mary must be recovered
for Charles, even at the point of the
sword.<a id="footnotetag191" name="footnotetag191"></a><a href="#footnote191">[191]</a>
Early in January,
Wolsey had written to her, warning her not to make any fresh promise
of marriage. Two friars from England, sent apparently by Suffolk's
secret enemies, told Mary the same tale, that if she returned to
England she would never be suffered to marry the Duke, but made to
take Charles for her husband, "than which," she declared, "I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page082" name="page082"></a>(p. 082)</span>
would rather be torn in
pieces".<a id="footnotetag192" name="footnotetag192"></a><a href="#footnote192">[192]</a>
Suffolk tried in vain to soothe
her fears. She refused to listen, and brought him to his knees with
the announcement that unless he would wed her there and then, she
would continue to believe that he had come only to entice her back to
England and force her into marriage with Charles. What was the poor
Duke to do, between his promise to Henry and the pleading of Mary? He
did what every other man with a heart in his breast and warm blood in
his veins would have done, he cast prudence to the winds and secretly
married the woman he loved.</p>

<p>The news could not be long concealed, but unfortunately we have only
Wolsey's account of how it was received by Henry. He took it, wrote
the cardinal to Suffolk, "grievously and displeasantly," not only on
account of the Duke's presumption, but of the breach of his promise to
Henry.<a id="footnotetag193" name="footnotetag193"></a><a href="#footnote193">[193]</a>
"You are," he added, "in the greatest danger man was ever
in;" the council were calling for his ruin. To appease Henry and
enable the King to satisfy his council, Suffolk must induce Francis to
intervene in his favour, to pay Henry two hundred thousand crowns as
Mary's dowry, and to restore the plate and jewels she had received;
the Duke himself was to return the fortune with which Henry had
endowed his sister and pay twenty-four thousand pounds in yearly
instalments for the expenses of her marriage. Francis proved
unexpectedly willing; perhaps his better nature was touched by the
lovers' distress. He also saw that Mary's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page083" name="page083"></a>(p. 083)</span>
marriage with
Suffolk prevented her being used as a link to bind Charles to Henry;
and he may have thought that a service to Suffolk would secure him a
powerful friend at the English Court, a calculation that was partly
justified by the suspicion under which Suffolk henceforth laboured, of
being too partial to Francis. Yet it was with heavy hearts that the
couple left Paris in April and wended their way towards Calais. Henry
had given no sign; from Calais, Mary wrote to him saying she would go
to a nunnery rather than marry against her
desire.<a id="footnotetag194" name="footnotetag194"></a><a href="#footnote194">[194]</a>
Suffolk threw
himself on the King's mercy; all the council, he said, except Wolsey,
were determined to put him to
death.<a id="footnotetag195" name="footnotetag195"></a><a href="#footnote195">[195]</a>
Secretly, against his
promise, and without Henry's consent, he had married the King's
sister, an act the temerity of which no one has since ventured to
rival. He saw the executioner's axe gleam before his eyes, and he
trembled.</p>

<p>At Calais, Mary said she would stay until she heard from the
King.<a id="footnotetag196" name="footnotetag196"></a><a href="#footnote196">[196]</a>
His message has not been preserved, but fears were never
more strangely belied than when the pair crossed their Rubicon. So far
from any attempt being made to separate them, their marriage was
publicly solemnised before Henry and all his Court on 13th May, at
Greenwich.<a id="footnotetag197" name="footnotetag197"></a><a href="#footnote197">[197]</a>
In spite of all that happened, wrote the Venetian
ambassador, Henry retained his friendship for
Suffolk;<a id="footnotetag198" name="footnotetag198"></a><a href="#footnote198">[198]</a>
and a few
months later he asserted, with some exaggeration, that the Duke's
authority was scarcely less than
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page084" name="page084"></a>(p. 084)</span>
the King's.<a id="footnotetag199" name="footnotetag199"></a><a href="#footnote199">[199]</a>
He and
Mary were indeed required to return all the endowment, whether in
money, plate, jewels or furniture, that she received on her marriage.
But both she and the Duke had agreed to these terms before their
offence.<a id="footnotetag200" name="footnotetag200"></a><a href="#footnote200">[200]</a>
They were not unreasonable. Henry's money had been laid
out for political purposes which could no longer be served; and Mary
did not expect the splendour, as Duchess of Suffolk, which she had
enjoyed as Queen of France. The only stipulation that looks like a
punishment was the bond to repay the cost of her journey to France;
though not only was this modified later on, but the Duke received
numerous grants of land to help to defray the charge. They were indeed
required to live in the country; but the Duke still came up to joust
as of old with Henry on great occasions, and Mary remained his
favourite sister, to whose issue, in preference to that of Margaret,
he left the crown by will. The vindictive suspicions which afterwards
grew to rank luxuriance in Henry's mind were scarcely budding as yet;
his favour to Suffolk and affection for Mary were proof against the
intrigues in his Court. The contrast was marked between the event and
the terrors which Wolsey had painted; and it is hard to believe that
the Cardinal played an entirely disinterested part in the
matter.<a id="footnotetag201" name="footnotetag201"></a><a href="#footnote201">[201]</a>
It was obviously his cue to exaggerate the King's anger, and to
represent to the Duke that its mitigation was due to the Cardinal's
influence; and it is more than possible that Wolsey found in Suffolk's
indiscretion the means of removing a dangerous rival. The "two
obstinate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page085" name="page085"></a>(p. 085)</span>
men" who had ruled in Henry's camp were not likely
to remain long united; Wolsey could hardly approve of any "second
king" but himself, especially a "second king" who had acquired a
family bond with the first. The Venetian ambassador plainly hints that
it was through Wolsey that Suffolk lost
favour.<a id="footnotetag202" name="footnotetag202"></a><a href="#footnote202">[202]</a>
In the occasional
notices of him during the next few years it is Wolsey, and not Henry,
whom Suffolk is trying to appease; and we even find the Cardinal
secretly warning the King against some designs of the Duke that
probably existed only in his own
imagination.<a id="footnotetag203" name="footnotetag203"></a><a href="#footnote203">[203]</a></p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>This episode threw into the shade the main purpose of Suffolk's
embassy to France. It was to renew the treaty concluded the year
before, and apparently also the discussions for war upon Spain.
Francis was ready enough to confirm the treaty, particularly as it
left him free to pursue his designs on Milan. With a similar object he
made terms with the Archduke Charles, who this year assumed the
government of the Netherlands, but was completely under the control of
Chièvres, a Frenchman by birth and sympathy, who signed his letters to
Francis "your humble servant and
vassal".<a id="footnotetag204" name="footnotetag204"></a><a href="#footnote204">[204]</a>
Charles bound himself
to marry Louis XII.'s daughter Renée, and to give his grandfather
Ferdinand no aid unless he restored Navarre to Jean d'Albret. Thus
safeguarded from attack on his rear, Francis set out for Milan. The
Swiss had locked all the passes they thought practicable; but the
French generals, guided by chamois hunters and overcoming almost
insuperable obstacles, transported their artillery
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page086" name="page086"></a>(p. 086)</span>
over the
Alps near Embrun; and on 13th September, at Marignano, the great
"Battle of the Giants" laid the whole of Northern Italy at the French
King's feet. At Bologna he met Leo X., whose lifelong endeavour was to
be found on both sides at once, or at least on the side of the bigger
battalions; the Pope recognised Francis's claim to Milan, while
Francis undertook to support the Medici in Florence, and to
countenance Leo's project for securing the Duchy of Urbino to his
nephew Lorenzo.</p>

<p>Henry watched with ill-concealed jealousy his rival's victorious
progress; his envy was personal, as well as political. "Francis,"
wrote the Bishop of Worcester in describing the interview between the
French King and the Pope at Bologna, "is tall in stature,
broad-shouldered, oval and handsome in face, very slender in the legs
and much inclined to
corpulence."<a id="footnotetag205" name="footnotetag205"></a><a href="#footnote205">[205]</a>
His appearance was the subject
of critical inquiry by Henry himself. On May Day, 1515,
Pasqualigo<a id="footnotetag206" name="footnotetag206"></a><a href="#footnote206">[206]</a>
was summoned to Greenwich by the King, whom he found
dressed in green, "shoes and all," and mounted on a bay Frieslander
sent him by the Marquis of Mantua; his guard were also dressed in
green and armed with bows and arrows for the usual May Day sports.
They breakfasted in green bowers some distance from the palace. "His
Majesty," continues Pasqualigo, "came into our arbor, and addressing
me in French, said: 'Talk with me awhile. The King of France, is he as
tall as I am?' I told him there was but little difference. He
continued, 'Is he as stout?' I said he was not; and he then inquired,
'What sort of legs
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page087" name="page087"></a>(p. 087)</span>
has he?' I replied 'Spare'. Whereupon he
opened the front of his doublet, and placing his hand on his thigh,
said: 'Look here; and I also have a good calf to my leg'. He then told
me he was very fond of this King of France, and that on more than
three occasions he was very near him with his army, but that he would
never allow himself to be seen, and always retreated, which His
Majesty attributed to deference for King Louis, who did not choose an
engagement to take place." After dinner, by way of showing his
prowess, Henry "armed himself <i>cap-à-pie</i> and ran thirty courses,
capsizing his opponent, horse and all". Two months later, he said to
Giustinian: "I am aware that King Louis, although my brother-in-law,
was a bad man. I know not what this youth may be; he is, however, a
Frenchman, nor can I say how far you should trust
him;"<a id="footnotetag207" name="footnotetag207"></a><a href="#footnote207">[207]</a>
and
Giustinian says he at once perceived the great rivalry for glory
between the two young kings.</p>

<p>Henry now complained that Francis had concealed his Italian enterprise
from him, that he was ill-treating English subjects, and interfering
with matters in Scotland. The last was his real and chief ground for
resentment. Francis had no great belief that Henry would keep the
peace, and resist the temptation to attack him, if a suitable
opportunity were to arise. So he had sent the Duke of Albany to
provide Henry with an absorbing disturbance in Scotland. Since the
death of James IV. at Flodden, English influence had, in Margaret's
hands, been largely increased. Henry took upon himself to demand a
voice in Scotland's internal affairs. He claimed the title of
"Protector of Scotland"; and wrote to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page088" name="page088"></a>(p. 088)</span>
the Pope asking him to
appoint no Scottish bishops without his consent, and to reduce the
Archbishopric of St. Andrews to its ancient dependence on
York.<a id="footnotetag208" name="footnotetag208"></a><a href="#footnote208">[208]</a>
Many urged him to complete the conquest of Scotland, but this
apparently he refused on the ground that his own sister was really its
ruler and his own infant nephew its king. Margaret, however, as an
Englishwoman, was hated in Scotland, and she destroyed much of her
influence by marrying the Earl of Angus. So the Scots clamoured for
Albany, who had long been resident at the French Court and was heir to
the Scottish throne, should James IV.'s issue fail. His appearance was
the utter discomfiture of the party of England; Margaret was besieged
in Stirling and ultimately forced to give up her children to Albany's
keeping, and seek safety in flight to her brother's
dominions.<a id="footnotetag209" name="footnotetag209"></a><a href="#footnote209">[209]</a></p>

<p>Technically, Francis had not broken his treaty with England, but he
had scarcely acted the part of a friend; and if Henry could retaliate
without breaking the peace, he would eagerly seize any opportunity
that offered. The alliance with Ferdinand and Maximilian was renewed,
and a new Holy League formed under Leo's auspices. But Leo soon
afterwards made his peace at Bologna with France. Charles was under
French influence, and Henry's council and people were not prepared for
war. So he refused, says Giustinian, Ferdinand's invitations to join
in an invasion of France. He did so from no love of Francis, and it
was probably Wolsey's ingenuity which suggested the not very
scrupulous means of gratifying Henry's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page089" name="page089"></a>(p. 089)</span>
wish for revenge.
Maximilian was still pursuing his endless quarrel with Venice; and the
seizure of Milan by the French and Venetian allies was a severe blow
to Maximilian himself, to the Swiss, and to their protégé, Sforza.
Wolsey now sought to animate them all for an attempt to recover the
duchy, and Sforza promised him 10,000 ducats a year from the date of
his restoration. There was nothing but the spirit of his treaty with
France to prevent Henry spending his money as he thought fit; and it
was determined to hire 20,000 Swiss mercenaries to serve under the
Emperor in order to conquer Milan and revenge
Marignano.<a id="footnotetag210" name="footnotetag210"></a><a href="#footnote210">[210]</a>
The
negotiation was one of great delicacy; not only was secrecy absolutely
essential, but the money must be carefully kept out of Maximilian's
reach. "Whenever," wrote Pace, "the King's money passed where the
Emperor was, he would always get some portion of it by force or false
promises of
restitution."<a id="footnotetag211" name="footnotetag211"></a><a href="#footnote211">[211]</a>
The accusation was justified by
Maximilian's order to Margaret, his daughter, to seize Henry's
treasure as soon as he heard it was on the way to the
Swiss.<a id="footnotetag212" name="footnotetag212"></a><a href="#footnote212">[212]</a>
"The
Emperor," said Julius II., "is light and inconstant, always begging
for other men's money, which he wastes in hunting the
chamois."<a id="footnotetag213" name="footnotetag213"></a><a href="#footnote213">[213]</a></p>

<p>The envoy selected for this difficult mission was Richard Pace,
scholar and author, and friend of Erasmus and More. He had been in
Bainbridge's service at Rome, was then transferred to that of Wolsey
and Henry, and as the King's secretary, was afterwards thought to be
treading too close on the Cardinal's heels. He set out in October, and
arrived in Zurich just in time to prevent the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page090" name="page090"></a>(p. 090)</span>
Swiss from
coming to terms with Francis. Before winter had ended the plans for
invasion were settled. Maximilian came down with the snows from the
mountains in March; on the 23rd he crossed the
Adda;<a id="footnotetag214" name="footnotetag214"></a><a href="#footnote214">[214]</a>
on the 25th
he was within nine miles of Milan, and almost in sight of the army of
France. On the 26th he turned and fled without striking a blow. Back
he went over the Adda, over the Oglio, up into Tyrol, leaving the
French and Venetians in secure possession of Northern Italy. A year
later they had recovered for Venice the last of the places of which it
had been robbed by the League of Cambrai.</p>

<p>Maximilian retreated, said Pace, voluntarily and shamefully, and was
now so degraded that it signified little whether he was a friend or an
enemy.<a id="footnotetag215" name="footnotetag215"></a><a href="#footnote215">[215]</a>
The cause of his ignominious flight still remains a
mystery; countless excuses were made by Maximilian and his friends. He
had heard that France and England had come to terms; 6,000 of the
Swiss infantry deserted to the French on the eve of the battle.
Ladislaus of Hungary had died, leaving him guardian of his son, and he
must go to arrange matters there. He had no money to pay his troops.
The last has an appearance of verisimilitude. Money was at the bottom
of all his difficulties, and drove him to the most ignominious shifts.
He had served as a private in Henry's army for 100 crowns a day. His
councillors robbed him; on one occasion he had not money to pay for
his
dinner;<a id="footnotetag216" name="footnotetag216"></a><a href="#footnote216">[216]</a>
on another he sent down to Pace, who was ill in bed,
and extorted a loan
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page091" name="page091"></a>(p. 091)</span>
by force. He had apparently seized
30,000 crowns of Henry's pay for the
Swiss;<a id="footnotetag217" name="footnotetag217"></a><a href="#footnote217">[217]</a>
the Fuggers, Welzers
and Frescobaldi, were also accused of failing to keep their
engagements, and only the first month's pay had been received by the
Swiss when they reached Milan. On the Emperor's retreat the wretched
Pace was seized by the Swiss and kept in prison as security for the
remainder.<a id="footnotetag218" name="footnotetag218"></a><a href="#footnote218">[218]</a>
His task had been rendered all the more difficult by
the folly of Wingfield, ambassador at Maximilian's Court, who, said
Pace, "took the Emperor for a god and believed that all his deeds and
thoughts proceeded <i>ex Spiritu
Sancto</i>".<a id="footnotetag219" name="footnotetag219"></a><a href="#footnote219">[219]</a>
There was no love lost
between them; the lively Pace nicknamed his colleague "Summer shall be
green," in illusion perhaps to Wingfield's unending platitudes, or to
his limitless belief in the Emperor's integrity and
wisdom.<a id="footnotetag220" name="footnotetag220"></a><a href="#footnote220">[220]</a>
Wingfield opened Pace's letters and discovered the gibe, which he
parried by avowing that he had never known the time when summer was
not green.<a id="footnotetag221" name="footnotetag221"></a><a href="#footnote221">[221]</a>
On another occasion he forged Pace's signature, with a
view of obtaining funds for
Maximilian;<a id="footnotetag222" name="footnotetag222"></a><a href="#footnote222">[222]</a>
and he had the hardihood
to protest against Pace's appointment as Henry's secretary. At last
his conduct brought down a stinging rebuke from
Henry;<a id="footnotetag223" name="footnotetag223"></a><a href="#footnote223">[223]</a>
but the
King's long-suffering was not yet exhausted, and Wingfield continued
as ambassador to the Emperors Court.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>The failure of the Milan expedition taught Wolsey and Henry a bitter
but salutary lesson. It was their first attempt to intervene in a
sphere of action so distant from English
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page092" name="page092"></a>(p. 092)</span>
shores and so
remote from English interests as the affairs of Italian States.
Complaints in England were loud against the waste of money; the
sagacious Tunstall wrote that he did not see why Henry should bind
himself to maintain other men's
causes.<a id="footnotetag224" name="footnotetag224"></a><a href="#footnote224">[224]</a>
All the grandees, wrote
Giustinian, were opposed to Wolsey's policy, and its adoption was
followed by what Giustinian called a change of ministry in
England.<a id="footnotetag225" name="footnotetag225"></a><a href="#footnote225">[225]</a>
Warham relinquished the burdens of the Chancellorship
which he had long unwillingly borne; Fox sought to atone for
twenty-eight years' neglect of his diocese by spending in it the rest
of his
days.<a id="footnotetag226" name="footnotetag226"></a><a href="#footnote226">[226]</a>
Wolsey succeeded Warham as Chancellor, and Ruthal,
who "sang treble to Wolsey's
bass,"<a id="footnotetag227" name="footnotetag227"></a><a href="#footnote227">[227]</a>
became Lord Privy Seal in
place of Fox. Suffolk was out of favour, and the neglect of his and
Fox's advice was, according to the Venetian, resented by the people,
who murmured against the taxes which Wolsey's intervention in foreign
affairs involved.</p>

<p>But Wolsey still hoped that bribes would keep Maximilian faithful to
England and induce him to counteract the French influences with which
his grandson Charles was surrounded. Ferdinand had died in January,
1516,<a id="footnotetag228" name="footnotetag228"></a><a href="#footnote228">[228]</a>
having, said the English envoy at his Court, wilfully
shortened his life by hunting and hawking in all weathers, and
following the advice of his falconers rather than that of his
physicians. Charles thus succeeded to Castile, Aragon and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page093" name="page093"></a>(p. 093)</span>
Naples;<a id="footnotetag229" name="footnotetag229"></a><a href="#footnote229">[229]</a>
but Naples was seriously threatened by the failure of
Maximilian's expedition and the omnipotence of Francis in Italy. "The
Pope is French," wrote an English diplomatist, "and everything from
Rome to
Calais."<a id="footnotetag230" name="footnotetag230"></a><a href="#footnote230">[230]</a>
To save Naples, Charles, in July, 1516, entered
into the humiliating Treaty of Noyon with
France.<a id="footnotetag231" name="footnotetag231"></a><a href="#footnote231">[231]</a>
He bound
himself to marry Francis's infant daughter, Charlotte, to do justice
to Jean d'Albret in the matter of Navarre, and to surrender Naples,
Navarre, and Artois, if he failed to keep his engagement. Such a
treaty was not likely to stand; but, for the time, it was a great
feather in Francis's cap, and a further step towards the isolation of
England. It was the work of Charles's Gallicised ministry, and
Maximilian professed the utmost disgust at their doings. He was eager
to come down to the Netherlands with a view to breaking the Treaty of
Noyon and removing his grandson's advisers, but of course he must have
money from England to pay his expenses. The money accordingly came
from the apparently bottomless English
purse;<a id="footnotetag232" name="footnotetag232"></a><a href="#footnote232">[232]</a>
and in January,
1517, the Emperor marched down to the Netherlands, breathing, in his
despatches to Henry, threatenings and slaughter against Charles's
misleaders. His descent on Flanders eclipsed his march on Milan. "Mon
fils," he said to Charles, "vous allez tromper les Français, et moi,
je vais tromper les
Anglais."<a id="footnotetag233" name="footnotetag233"></a><a href="#footnote233">[233]</a>
So far from breaking the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page094" name="page094"></a>(p. 094)</span>
Treaty of Noyon, he joined it himself, and at Brussels solemnly swore
to observe its provisions. He probably thought he had touched the
bottom of Henry's purse, and that it was time to dip into Francis's.
Seventy-five thousand crowns was his price for betraying
Henry.<a id="footnotetag234" name="footnotetag234"></a><a href="#footnote234">[234]</a></p>

<p>In conveying the news to Wolsey, Tunstall begged him to urge Henry "to
refrain from his first passions" and "to draw his foot out of the
affair as gently as if he perceived it not, giving good words for good
words which they yet give us, thinking our heads to be so gross that
we perceive not their
abuses".<a id="footnotetag235" name="footnotetag235"></a><a href="#footnote235">[235]</a>
Their persistent advances to
Charles had, he thought, done them more harm than good; let the King
shut his purse in time, and he would soon have Charles and the Emperor
again at his
feet.<a id="footnotetag236" name="footnotetag236"></a><a href="#footnote236">[236]</a>
Tunstall was ably seconded by Dr. William
Knight, who thought it would be foolish for England to attempt to undo
the Treaty of Noyon; it contained within itself the seeds of its own
dissolution. Charles would not wait to marry Francis's daughter, and
then the breach would
come.<a id="footnotetag237" name="footnotetag237"></a><a href="#footnote237">[237]</a>
Henry and Wolsey had the good sense
to act on this sound advice. Maximilian, Francis and Charles formed at
Cambrai a fresh league for the partition of
Italy,<a id="footnotetag238" name="footnotetag238"></a><a href="#footnote238">[238]</a>
but they were
soon at enmity and too much involved with their own affairs to think
of the conquest of others. Disaffection was rife in Spain, where a
party wished Ferdinand, Charles's brother, to be
King.<a id="footnotetag239" name="footnotetag239"></a><a href="#footnote239">[239]</a>
If Charles
was to retain his Spanish kingdoms, he must visit them at once. He
could not go unless England provided
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page095" name="page095"></a>(p. 095)</span>
the means. His request
for a loan was graciously accorded and his ambassadors were treated
with magnificent
courtesy.<a id="footnotetag240" name="footnotetag240"></a><a href="#footnote240">[240]</a>
"One day," says
Chieregati,<a id="footnotetag241" name="footnotetag241"></a><a href="#footnote241">[241]</a>
the
papal envoy in England, "the King sent for these ambassadors, and kept
them to dine with him privately in his chamber with the Queen, a very
unusual proceeding. After dinner he took to singing and playing on
every musical instrument, and exhibited a part of his very excellent
endowments. At length he commenced dancing," and, continues another
narrator, "doing marvellous things, both in dancing and jumping,
proving himself, as he is in truth, indefatigable." On another day
there was "a most stately joust." Henry was magnificently attired in
"cloth of silver with a raised pile, and wrought throughout with
emblematic letters". When he had made the usual display in the lists,
the Duke of Suffolk entered from the other end, with well-nigh equal
array and pomp. He was accompanied by fourteen other jousters. "The
King wanted to joust with all of them; but this was forbidden by the
council, which, moreover, decided that each jouster was to run six
courses and no more, so that the entertainment might be ended on that
day.... The competitor assigned to the King was the Duke of Suffolk;
and they bore themselves so bravely that the spectators fancied
themselves witnessing a joust between Hector and Achilles." "They
tilted," says Sagudino, "eight courses, both shivering their lances at
every time, to the great applause of the spectators." Chieregati
continues: "On arriving in the lists the King presented himself before
the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page096" name="page096"></a>(p. 096)</span>
Queen and the ladies, making a thousand jumps in the
air, and after tiring one horse, he entered the tent and mounted
another... doing this constantly, and reappearing in the lists until
the end of the jousts". Dinner was then served, amid a scene of
unparalleled splendour, and Chieregati avers that the "guests remained
at table for seven hours by the clock". The display of costume on the
King's part was equally varied and gorgeous. On one occasion he wore
"stiff brocade in the Hungarian fashion," on another, he "was dressed
in white damask in the Turkish fashion, the above-mentioned robe all
embroidered with roses, made of rubies and diamonds"; on a third, he
"wore royal robes down to the ground, of gold brocade lined with
ermine"; while "all the rest of the Court glittered with jewels and
gold and silver, the pomp being unprecedented".</p>

<p>All this riot of wealth would no doubt impress the impecunious
Charles. In September he landed in Spain, so destitute that he was
glad to accept the offer of a hobby from the English
ambassador.<a id="footnotetag242" name="footnotetag242"></a><a href="#footnote242">[242]</a>
At the first meeting of his Cortes, they demanded that he should marry
at once, and not wait for Francis's daughter; the bride his subjects
desired was the daughter of the King of
Portugal.<a id="footnotetag243" name="footnotetag243"></a><a href="#footnote243">[243]</a>
They were no
more willing to part with Navarre; and Charles was forced to make to
Francis the feeble excuse that he was not aware, when he was in the
Netherlands, of his true title to Navarre, but had learnt it since his
arrival in Spain; he also declined the personal interview to which
Francis invited
him.<a id="footnotetag244" name="footnotetag244"></a><a href="#footnote244">[244]</a>
A rupture between Francis and Charles was
only a question of time; and, to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page097" name="page097"></a>(p. 097)</span>
prepare for it, both were
anxious for England's alliance. Throughout the autumn of 1517 and
spring of 1518, France and England were feeling their way towards
friendship. Albany had left Scotland, so that source of irritation was
gone. Henry had now a daughter, Mary, and Francis a son. "I will unite
them," said
Wolsey;<a id="footnotetag245" name="footnotetag245"></a><a href="#footnote245">[245]</a>
and in October, 1518, not only was a treaty
of marriage and alliance signed between England and France, but a
general peace for Europe. Leo X. sent Campeggio with blessings of
peace from the Vicar of Christ, though he was kept chafing at Calais
for three months, till he could bring with him Leo's appointment of
Wolsey as legate and the deposition of Wolsey's enemy, Hadrian, from
the Bishopric of Bath and
Wells.<a id="footnotetag246" name="footnotetag246"></a><a href="#footnote246">[246]</a>
The ceremonies exceeded in
splendour even those of the year before. They included, says
Giustinian, a "most sumptuous supper" at Wolsey's house, "the like of
which, I fancy, was never given by Cleopatra or Caligula; the whole
banqueting hall being so decorated with huge vases of gold and silver,
that I fancied myself in the tower of
Chosroes,<a id="footnotetag247" name="footnotetag247"></a><a href="#footnote247">[247]</a>
when that monarch
caused Divine honours to be paid him. After supper... twelve male and
twelve female dancers made their appearance in the richest and most
sumptuous array possible, being all dressed alike.... They were
disguised in one suit of fine green satin, all over covered with cloth
of gold, undertied together with laces of gold, and had masking hoods
on their heads; the ladies had tires made of braids of damask gold,
with long hairs of white gold. All these maskers danced at one time,
and after they had danced they put off
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page098" name="page098"></a>(p. 098)</span>
their visors, and
then they were all known.... The two leaders were the King and the
Queen Dowager of France, and all the others were lords and
ladies."<a id="footnotetag248" name="footnotetag248"></a><a href="#footnote248">[248]</a>
These festivities were followed by the formal
ratification of
peace.<a id="footnotetag249" name="footnotetag249"></a><a href="#footnote249">[249]</a>
Approval of it was general, and the old
councillors who had been alienated by Wolsey's Milan expedition,
hastened to applaud. "It was the best deed," wrote Fox to Wolsey,
"that ever was done for England, and, next to the King, the praise of
it is due to
you."<a id="footnotetag250" name="footnotetag250"></a><a href="#footnote250">[250]</a>
Once more the wheel had come round, and the
stone of Sisyphus was lodged more secure than before some way up the
side of the hill.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>This general peace, which closed the wars begun ten years before by
the League of Cambrai, was not entirely due to a universal desire to
beat swords into ploughshares or to even turn them against the Turk.
That was the everlasting pretence, but eighteen months before,
Maximilian had suffered a stroke of apoplexy; men, said Giustinian,
commenting on the fact, did not usually survive such strokes a year,
and rivals were preparing to enter the lists for the Empire.
Maximilian himself, faithful to the end to his guiding principle,
found a last inspiration in the idea of disposing of his succession
for ready money. He was writing to Charles that it was useless to
expect the Empire unless he would spend at least as much as the
French.<a id="footnotetag251" name="footnotetag251"></a><a href="#footnote251">[251]</a>
"It would be lamentable," he said, "if we should now lose
all through some pitiful omission or penurious neglect;" and Francis
was "going about
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page099" name="page099"></a>(p. 099)</span>
covertly and laying many
baits,"<a id="footnotetag252" name="footnotetag252"></a><a href="#footnote252">[252]</a>
to
attain the imperial crown. To Henry himself Maximilian had more than
once offered the prize, and Pace had declared that the offer was only
another design for extracting Henry's gold "for the electors would
never allow the crown to go out of their
nation".<a id="footnotetag253" name="footnotetag253"></a><a href="#footnote253">[253]</a>
The Emperor had
first proposed it while serving under Henry's banners in
France.<a id="footnotetag254" name="footnotetag254"></a><a href="#footnote254">[254]</a>
He renewed the suggestion in 1516, inviting Henry to meet him at
Coire. The brothers in arms were thence to cross the Alps to Milan,
where the Emperor would invest the English King with the duchy; he
would then take him on to Rome, resign the Empire himself, and have
Henry crowned. Not that Maximilian desired to forsake all earthly
authority; he sought to combine a spiritual with a temporal glory; he
was to lay down the imperial crown and place on his brows the papal
tiara.<a id="footnotetag255" name="footnotetag255"></a><a href="#footnote255">[255]</a>
Nothing was too fantastic for the Emperor Maximilian; the
man who could not wrest a few towns from Venice was always deluding
himself with the hope of leading victorious hosts to the seat of the
Turkish Empire and the Holy City of Christendom; the sovereign whose
main incentive in life was gold, informed his daughter that he
intended to get himself canonised, and that after his death she would
have to adore him. He died at Welz on 12th January, 1519, neither Pope
nor saint, with Jerusalem still in the hands of the Turk, and the
succession to the Empire still undecided.</p>

<p>The contest now broke out in earnest, and the electors prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span>
to garner their harvest of gold. The price of a vote was a
hundredfold more than the most corrupt parliamentary elector could
conceive in his wildest dreams of avarice. There were only seven
electors and the prize was the greatest on earth. Francis I. said he
was ready to spend 3,000,000 crowns, and Charles could not afford to
lag far
behind.<a id="footnotetag256" name="footnotetag256"></a><a href="#footnote256">[256]</a>
The Margrave of Brandenburg, "the father of all
greediness," as the Austrians called him, was particularly influential
because his brother, the Archbishop of Mainz, was also an elector and
he required an especially exorbitant bribe. He was ambitious as well
as covetous, and the rivals endeavoured to satisfy his ambitions with
matrimonial prizes. He was promised Ferdinand's widow, Germaine de
Foix; Francis sought to parry this blow by offering to the Margrave's
son the French Princess Renée; Charles bid higher by offering his
sister
Catherine.<a id="footnotetag257" name="footnotetag257"></a><a href="#footnote257">[257]</a>
Francis relied much on his personal graces, the
military renown he had won by the conquest of Northern Italy, and the
assistance of Leo. With the Pope he concluded a fresh treaty that year
for the conquest of Ferrara, the extension of the papal States, and
the settlement of Naples on Francis's second son, on condition that it
was meanwhile to be administered by papal
legates,<a id="footnotetag258" name="footnotetag258"></a><a href="#footnote258">[258]</a>
and that its
king was to abstain from all interference in spiritual matters.
Charles, on the other hand, owed his advantages to his position and
not to his person. Cold, reserved and formal, he possessed none of the
physical or intellectual graces
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>(p. 101)</span>
of Francis I. and Henry
VIII. He excelled in no sport, was unpleasant in features and
repellent in manners. No gleam of magnanimity or chivalry lightened
his character, no deeds in war or statecraft yet sounded his fame. He
was none the less heir of the Austrian House, which for generations
had worn the imperial crown; as such, too, he was a German prince, and
the Germanic constitution forbade any other the sovereignty of the
Holy Roman Empire. Against this was the fact that his enormous
dominions, including Naples and Spain, would preclude his continued
residence in Germany and might threaten the liberties of the German
people.</p>

<p>But was there no third candidate? Leo at heart regarded the election
of either as an absolute
evil.<a id="footnotetag259" name="footnotetag259"></a><a href="#footnote259">[259]</a>
He had always dreaded Maximilian's
claims to the temporal power of the Church, though Maximilian held not
a foot of Italian soil. How much more would he dread those claims in
the hands of Francis or Charles! One threatened the papal States from
Milan, and the other from Naples. Of the two, he feared Francis the
less;<a id="footnotetag260" name="footnotetag260"></a><a href="#footnote260">[260]</a>
for the union of Naples with the Empire had been such a
terror to the Popes, that before granting the investiture of that
kingdom, they bound its king by oath not to compete for the
Empire.<a id="footnotetag261" name="footnotetag261"></a><a href="#footnote261">[261]</a>
But a third candidate would offer an escape from between
the upper and the nether mill-stone; and Leo suggested at one time
Charles's brother
Ferdinand,<a id="footnotetag262" name="footnotetag262"></a><a href="#footnote262">[262]</a>
at another a German elector.
Precisely the same recommendations had been secretly made by Henry
VIII. In public he followed the course he commended to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>(p. 102)</span>
Leo;
he advocated the claims of both Charles and Francis, when asked so to
do, but sent trusty envoys with his testimonials to explain that no
credence was to be given
them.<a id="footnotetag263" name="footnotetag263"></a><a href="#footnote263">[263]</a>
He told the French King that he
favoured the election of Francis, and the Spanish King the election of
Charles, but like Leo he desired in truth the election of neither. Why
should he not come forward himself? His dominions were not so
extensive that, when combined with the imperial dignity, they would
threaten to dominate Europe; and his election might seem to provide a
useful check in the balance of power. In March he had already told
Francis that his claims were favoured by some of the electors, though
he professed a wish to promote the French King's pretensions. In May,
Pace was sent to Germany with secret instructions to endeavour to
balance the parties and force the electors into a deadlock, from which
the only escape would be the election of a third candidate, either
Henry himself or some German prince. It is difficult to believe that
Henry really thought his election possible or was seriously pushing
his claim. He had repeatedly declined Maximilian's offers; he had been
as often warned by trusty advisers that no non-German prince stood a
chance of election; he had expressed his content with his own islands,
which, Tunstall told him with truth, were an Empire worth more than
the barren imperial
crown.<a id="footnotetag264" name="footnotetag264"></a><a href="#footnote264">[264]</a>
Pace went far too late to secure a
party for Henry, and, what was even more fatal, he went without the
persuasive of money. Norfolk told Giustinian, after Pace's departure,
that the election would fall on a German prince, and such, said the
Venetian, was the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>(p. 103)</span>
universal belief and desire in
England.<a id="footnotetag265" name="footnotetag265"></a><a href="#footnote265">[265]</a>
After the election, Leo expressed his "regret that Henry
gave no attention to a project which would have made him a near,
instead of a distant, neighbour of the papal States". Under the
circumstances, it seems more probable that the first alternative in
Pace's instructions no more represented a settled design in Henry's
mind than his often-professed intention of conquering France, and that
the real purport of his mission was to promote the election of the
Duke of Saxony or another German
prince.<a id="footnotetag266" name="footnotetag266"></a><a href="#footnote266">[266]</a></p>

<p>Whether that was its object or not the mission was foredoomed to
failure. The conclusion was never really in doubt. Electors might
trouble the waters in order to fish with more success. They might
pretend to Francis that if he was free with his money he might be
elected, and to Charles that unless he was free with his money he
would not, but no sufficient reason had been shown why they should
violate national prejudices, the laws of the Empire, and prescriptive
hereditary right, in order to place Henry or Francis instead of a
German upon the imperial throne. Neither people nor princes nor
barons, wrote Leo's envoys, would permit the election of the Most
Christian
King;<a id="footnotetag267" name="footnotetag267"></a><a href="#footnote267">[267]</a>
and even if the electors wished to elect him, it
was not in their power to do so. The whole of the nation, said Pace,
was in arms and furious for Charles; and had Henry been elected, they
would in their indignation have killed Pace and all his
servants.<a id="footnotetag268" name="footnotetag268"></a><a href="#footnote268">[268]</a>
The voice of the German people spoke in no uncertain tones; they would
have Charles and no other to be their ruler. Leo himself saw
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span>
the futility of resistance, and making a virtue of necessity, he sent
Charles an absolution from his oath as King of Naples. As soon as it
arrived, the electors unanimously declared Charles their Emperor on
28th June.<a id="footnotetag269" name="footnotetag269"></a><a href="#footnote269">[269]</a></p>

<p>Thus was completed the shuffling of the cards for the struggle which
lasted till Henry's death. Francis had now succeeded to Louis, Charles
to both his grandfathers, and Henry at twenty-eight was the <i>doyen</i> of
the princes of Europe. He was two years older than Francis and eight
years older than Charles. Europe had passed under the rule of youthful
triumvirs whose rivalry troubled its peace and guided its destinies
for nearly thirty years. The youngest of all was the greatest in
power. His dominions, it is true, were disjointed, and funds were
often to seek, but these defects have been overrated. It was neither
of these which proved his greatest embarrassment. It was a cloud in
Germany, as yet no bigger than a man's hand, but soon to darken the
face of Europe. Ferdinand and Maximilian had at times been dangerous;
Charles wielded the power of both. He ruled over Castile and Aragon,
the Netherlands and Naples, Burgundy and Austria; he could command the
finest military forces in Europe; the infantry of Spain, the science
of Italy, the lance-knights of Germany, for which Ferdinand sighed,
were at his disposal; and the wealth of the Indies was poured out at
his feet. He bestrode the narrow world like a Colossus, and the only
hope of lesser men lay in the maintenance of Francis's power. Were
that to fail, Charles would become arbiter of Christendom, Italy a
Spanish kingdom, and the Pope little
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>(p. 105)</span>
more than the Emperor's
chaplain. "Great masters," said Tunstall, with reference to a papal
brief urged by Charles in excuse for his action in 1517, "could get
great clerks to say what they
liked."<a id="footnotetag270" name="footnotetag270"></a><a href="#footnote270">[270]</a>
The mastery of Charles in
1517 was but the shadow of what it became ten years later; and if
under its dominance "the great clerk" were called upon to decide
between "the great master" and Henry, it was obvious already that all
Henry's services to the Papacy would count for nothing.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>For the present, those services were to be remembered. They were not,
indeed, inconsiderable. It would be absurd to maintain that, since his
accession, Henry had been actuated by respect for the Papacy more than
by another motive; but it is indisputable that that motive had entered
more largely into his conduct than into that of any other monarch.
James IV. and Louis had been excommunicated, Maximilian had
obstinately countenanced a schismatic council and wished to arrogate
to himself the Pope's temporal power. Ferdinand's zeal for his house
had eaten him up and left little room for less selfish impulses; his
anxiety for war with the Moor or the Turk was but a cloak; and the
value of his frequent demands for a Reformation may be gauged by his
opinion that never was there more need for the Inquisition, and by his
anger with Leo for refusing the Inquisitors the preferments he
asked.<a id="footnotetag271" name="footnotetag271"></a><a href="#footnote271">[271]</a>
From hypocrisy like Ferdinand's Henry was, in his early
years, singularly free, and the devotion to the Holy See, which he
inherited, was of a more than conventional type. "He is very
religious," wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>(p. 106)</span>
Giustinian, "and hears three masses daily
when he hunts, and sometimes five on other days. He hears the office
every day in the Queen's chamber, that is to say, vesper and
compline."<a id="footnotetag272" name="footnotetag272"></a><a href="#footnote272">[272]</a>
The best theologians and doctors in his kingdom were
regularly required to preach at his Court, when their fee for each
sermon was equivalent to ten or twelve pounds. He was generous in his
almsgiving, and his usual offering on Sundays and saints' days was six
shillings and eightpence or, in modern currency, nearly four pounds;
often it was double that amount, and there were special offerings
besides, such as the twenty shillings he sent every year to the shrine
of St. Thomas at Canterbury. In January, 1511, the gentlemen of the
King's chapel were paid what would now be seventy-five pounds for
praying for the Queen's safe delivery, and similar sums were no doubt
paid on other
occasions.<a id="footnotetag273" name="footnotetag273"></a><a href="#footnote273">[273]</a>
In 1513, Catherine thought Henry's
success was all due to his zeal for
religion,<a id="footnotetag274" name="footnotetag274"></a><a href="#footnote274">[274]</a>
and a year or two
later Erasmus wrote that Henry's Court was an example to all
Christendom for learning and
piety.<a id="footnotetag275" name="footnotetag275"></a><a href="#footnote275">[275]</a></p>

<p>Piety went hand in hand with a filial respect for the head of the
Church. Not once in the ten years is there to be found any expression
from Henry of contempt for the Pope, whether he was Julius II. or Leo
X. There had been no occasion on which Pope and King had been brought
into conflict, and almost throughout they had acted in perfect
harmony. It was the siege of Julius by Louis that drew Henry from his
peaceful policy to intervene as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>(p. 107)</span>
the champion of the Papal
See, and it was as the executor of papal censures that he made war on
France.<a id="footnotetag276" name="footnotetag276"></a><a href="#footnote276">[276]</a>
If he had ulterior views on that kingdom, he could plead
the justification of a brief, drawn up if not published, by Julius
II., investing him with the French
crown.<a id="footnotetag277" name="footnotetag277"></a><a href="#footnote277">[277]</a>
A papal envoy came to
urge peace in 1514, and a Pope claimed first to have suggested the
marriage between Mary and
Louis.<a id="footnotetag278" name="footnotetag278"></a><a href="#footnote278">[278]</a>
The Milan expedition of 1516 was
made under cover of a new Holy League concluded in the spring of the
previous year, and the peace of 1518 was made with the full approval
and blessings of Leo. Henry's devotion had been often acknowledged in
words, and twice by tangible tokens of gratitude, in the gift of the
golden rose in 1510 and of the sword and cap in
1513.<a id="footnotetag279" name="footnotetag279"></a><a href="#footnote279">[279]</a>
But did not
his services merit some more signal mark of favour? If Ferdinand was
"Catholic," and Louis "Most Christian," might not some title be found
for a genuine friend? And, as early as 1515, Henry was pressing the
Pope for "some title as protector of the Holy
See".<a id="footnotetag280" name="footnotetag280"></a><a href="#footnote280">[280]</a>
Various names
were suggested, "King Apostolic," "King Orthodox," and others; and in
January, 1516, we find the first mention of "Fidei
Defensor".<a id="footnotetag281" name="footnotetag281"></a><a href="#footnote281">[281]</a>
But
the prize was to be won by services more appropriate to the title than
even ten years' maintenance of the Pope's temporal interests. His
championship of the Holy See had been the most unselfish part of
Henry's policy since he came to the throne; and his whole conduct had
been an example, which others were slow to follow, and which Henry
himself was soon to neglect.</p>





<h3>CHAPTER V.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>(p. 108)</span></h3>

<h4>KING AND CARDINAL.</h4>


<p>"Nothing," wrote Giustinian of Wolsey in 1519, "pleases him more than
to be called the arbiter of
Christendom."<a id="footnotetag282" name="footnotetag282"></a><a href="#footnote282">[282]</a>
Continental statesmen
were inclined to ridicule and resent the Cardinal's claim. But the
title hardly exaggerates the part which the English minister was
enabled to play during the next few years by the rivalry of Charles
and Francis, and by the apparently even balance of their powers. The
position which England held in the councils of Europe in 1519 was a
marvellous advance upon that which it had occupied in 1509. The first
ten years of Henry's reign had been a period of fluctuating, but
continual, progress. The campaign of 1513 had vindicated England's
military prowess, and had made it possible for Wolsey, at the peace of
the following year, to place his country on a level with France and
Spain and the Empire. Francis's conquest of Milan, and the haste with
which Maximilian, Leo and Charles sought to make terms with the
victor, caused a temporary isolation of England and a consequent
decline in her influence. But the arrangements made between Charles
and Francis contained, in themselves, as acute English diplomatists
saw, the seeds of future disruption; and, in 1518, Wolsey was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>(p. 109)</span>
able so to play off these mutual jealousies as to reassert
England's position. He imposed a general peace, or rather a truce,
which raised England even higher than the treaties of 1514 had done,
and made her appear as the conservator of the peace of Europe. England
had almost usurped the place of the Pope as mediator between rival
Christian
princes.<a id="footnotetag283" name="footnotetag283"></a><a href="#footnote283">[283]</a></p>

<p>These brilliant results were achieved with the aid of very moderate
military forces and an only respectable navy. They were due partly to
the lavish expenditure of Henry's treasures, partly to the extravagant
faith of other princes in the extent of England's wealth, but mainly
to the genius for diplomacy displayed by the great English Cardinal.
Wolsey had now reached the zenith of his power; and the growth of his
sense of his own importance is graphically described by the Venetian
ambassador. When Giustinian first arrived in England, Wolsey used to
say, "His Majesty will do so and so". Subsequently, by degrees,
forgetting himself, he commenced saying, "We shall do so and so". In
1519 he had reached such a pitch that he used to say, "I shall do so
and so".<a id="footnotetag284" name="footnotetag284"></a><a href="#footnote284">[284]</a>
Fox had been called by Badoer "a second King," but
Wolsey was now "the King
himself".<a id="footnotetag285" name="footnotetag285"></a><a href="#footnote285">[285]</a>
"We have to deal," said Fox,
"with the Cardinal, who is not Cardinal, but King; and no one in the
realm dares attempt aught in opposition to his
interests."<a id="footnotetag286" name="footnotetag286"></a><a href="#footnote286">[286]</a>
On
another occasion Giustinian remarks: "This Cardinal is King, nor does
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>(p. 110)</span>
His Majesty depart in the least from the opinion and counsel
of his
lordship".<a id="footnotetag287" name="footnotetag287"></a><a href="#footnote287">[287]</a>
Sir Thomas More, in describing the negotiations
for the peace of 1518, reports that only after Wolsey had concluded a
point did he tell the council, "so that even the King hardly knows in
what state matters
are".<a id="footnotetag288" name="footnotetag288"></a><a href="#footnote288">[288]</a>
A month or two later there was a curious
dispute between the Earl of Worcester and West, Bishop of Ely, who
were sent to convey the Treaty of London to Francis. Worcester, as a
layman, was a partisan of the King, West of the Cardinal. Worcester
insisted that their detailed letters should be addressed to Henry, and
only general ones to Wolsey. West refused; the important letters, he
thought, should go to the Cardinal, the formal ones to the King; and,
eventually, identical despatches were sent to
both.<a id="footnotetag289" name="footnotetag289"></a><a href="#footnote289">[289]</a>
In
negotiations with England, Giustinian told his Government, "if it were
necessary to neglect either King or Cardinal, it would be better to
pass over the King; he would therefore make the proposal to both, but
to the Cardinal first, <i>lest he should resent the precedence conceded
to the
King</i>".<a id="footnotetag290" name="footnotetag290"></a><a href="#footnote290">[290]</a>
The popular charge against Wolsey, repeated by
Shakespeare, of having written <i>Ego et rex meus</i>, though true in
fact,<a id="footnotetag291" name="footnotetag291"></a><a href="#footnote291">[291]</a>
is false in intention, because no Latin scholar could put
the words in any other order; but the Cardinal's mental attitude is
faithfully represented in the meaning which the familiar phrase was
supposed to convey.</p>

<p>His
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>(p. 111)</span>
arrogance does not rest merely on the testimony of
personal enemies like the historian, Polydore Vergil, and the poet
Skelton, or of chroniclers like Hall, who wrote when vilification of
Wolsey pleased both king and people, but on the despatches of
diplomatists with whom he had to deal, and on the reports of observers
who narrowly watched his demeanour. "He is," wrote one, "the proudest
prelate that ever
breathed."<a id="footnotetag292" name="footnotetag292"></a><a href="#footnote292">[292]</a>
During the festivities of the
Emperor's visit to England, in 1520, Wolsey alone sat down to dinner
with the royal party, while peers, like the Dukes of Suffolk and
Buckingham, performed menial offices for the Cardinal, as well as for
Emperor, King and
Queen.<a id="footnotetag293" name="footnotetag293"></a><a href="#footnote293">[293]</a>
When he celebrated mass at the Field of
Cloth of Gold, bishops invested him with his robes and put sandals on
his feet, and "some of the chief noblemen in England" brought water to
wash his
hands.<a id="footnotetag294" name="footnotetag294"></a><a href="#footnote294">[294]</a>
A year later, at his meeting with Charles at
Bruges, he treated the Emperor as an equal. He did not dismount from
his mule, but merely doffed his cap, and embraced as a brother the
temporal head of
Christendom.<a id="footnotetag295" name="footnotetag295"></a><a href="#footnote295">[295]</a>
When, after a dispute with the
Venetian ambassador, he wished to be friendly, he allowed Giustinian,
with royal condescension, and as a special mark of favour, to kiss his
hand.<a id="footnotetag296" name="footnotetag296"></a><a href="#footnote296">[296]</a>
He never granted audience either to English peers or
foreign ambassadors until the third or fourth time of
asking.<a id="footnotetag297" name="footnotetag297"></a><a href="#footnote297">[297]</a>
In
1515 it was the custom of ambassadors to dine with Wolsey before
presentation at Court, but four years later they were never served
until the viands had been removed from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>(p. 112)</span>
the Cardinal's
table.<a id="footnotetag298" name="footnotetag298"></a><a href="#footnote298">[298]</a>
A Venetian, describing Wolsey's embassy to France in 1527,
relates that his "attendants served cap in hand, and, when bringing
the dishes, knelt before him in the act of presenting them. Those who
waited on the Most Christian King, kept their caps on their heads,
dispensing with such exaggerated
ceremonies."<a id="footnotetag299" name="footnotetag299"></a><a href="#footnote299">[299]</a></p>

<p>Pretenders to royal honours seldom acquire the grace of genuine
royalty, and the Cardinal pursued with vindictive ferocity those who
offended his sensitive dignity. In 1515, Polydore Vergil said, in
writing to his friend, Cardinal Hadrian, that Wolsey was so tyrannical
towards all men that his influence could not last, and that all
England abused
him.<a id="footnotetag300" name="footnotetag300"></a><a href="#footnote300">[300]</a>
The letter was copied by Wolsey's secretary,
Vergil was sent to the
Tower,<a id="footnotetag301" name="footnotetag301"></a><a href="#footnote301">[301]</a>
and only released after many months
at the repeated intercession of Leo X. His correspondent, Cardinal
Hadrian, was visited with Wolsey's undying hatred. A pretext for his
ruin was found in his alleged complicity in a plot to poison the Pope;
the charge was trivial, and Leo forgave
him.<a id="footnotetag302" name="footnotetag302"></a><a href="#footnote302">[302]</a>
Not so Wolsey, who
procured Hadrian's deprivation of the Bishopric of Bath and Wells,
appropriated the see for himself, and in 1518 kept Campeggio, the
Pope's legate, chafing at Calais until he could bring with him the
papal confirmation of these
measures.<a id="footnotetag303" name="footnotetag303"></a><a href="#footnote303">[303]</a>
Venice had the temerity to
intercede with Leo on Hadrian's behalf; Wolsey thereupon overwhelmed
Giustinian with "rabid and insolent language"; ordered him not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>(p. 113)</span>
to put anything in his despatches without his consent; and
revoked the privileges of Venetian merchants in
England.<a id="footnotetag304" name="footnotetag304"></a><a href="#footnote304">[304]</a>
In these
outbursts of fury, he paid little respect to the sacrosanct character
of ambassadors. He heard that the papal nuncio, Chieregati, was
sending to France unfavourable reports of his conduct. The nuncio "was
sent for by Wolsey, who took him into a private chamber, laid rude
hands upon him, fiercely demanding what he had written to the King of
France, and what intercourse he had held with Giustinian and his son,
adding that he should not quit the spot until he had confessed
everything, and, if fair means were not sufficient, he should be put
upon the
rack".<a id="footnotetag305" name="footnotetag305"></a><a href="#footnote305">[305]</a>
Nine years later, Wolsey nearly precipitated war
between England and the Emperor by a similar outburst against
Charles's ambassador, De Praet. He intercepted De Praet's
correspondence, and confined him to his house. It was a flagrant
breach of international law. Tampering with diplomatic correspondence
was usually considered a sufficient cause for war; on this occasion
war did not suit Charles's purpose, but it was no fault of Wolsey's
that his fury at an alleged personal slight did not provoke
hostilities with the most powerful prince in
Christendom.<a id="footnotetag306" name="footnotetag306"></a><a href="#footnote306">[306]</a></p>

<p>Englishmen fared no better than others at Wolsey's hands. He used the
coercive power of the State to revenge his private wrongs as well as
to secure the peace of the realm. In July, 1517, Sir Robert
Sheffield,<a id="footnotetag307" name="footnotetag307"></a><a href="#footnote307">[307]</a>
who had been Speaker in two Parliaments, was sent to
the Tower for complaining of Wolsey, and to point the moral of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span>
Fox's assertion, that none durst do ought in opposition to the
Cardinal's
interests.<a id="footnotetag308" name="footnotetag308"></a><a href="#footnote308">[308]</a>
Again, the idea reflected by Shakespeare,
that Wolsey was jealous of Pace, has been described as absurd; but it
is difficult to draw any other inference from the relations between
them after 1521. While Wolsey was absent at Calais, he accused Pace,
without ground, of misrepresenting his letters to Henry, and of
obtaining Henry's favour on behalf of a canon of
York;<a id="footnotetag309" name="footnotetag309"></a><a href="#footnote309">[309]</a>
he
complained that foreign powers were trusting to another influence than
his over the King; and, when he returned, he took care that Pace
should henceforth be employed, not as secretary to Henry, but on
almost continuous missions to Italy. In 1525, when the Venetian
ambassador was to thank Henry for making a treaty with Venice, which
Pace had concluded, he was instructed not to praise him so highly, if
the Cardinal were present, as if the oration were made to Henry
alone;<a id="footnotetag310" name="footnotetag310"></a><a href="#footnote310">[310]</a>
and, four years later, Wolsey found an occasion for
sending Pace to the Tower&mdash;treatment which eventually caused Pace's
mind to become
unhinged.<a id="footnotetag311" name="footnotetag311"></a><a href="#footnote311">[311]</a></p>

<p>Wolsey's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>(p. 115)</span>
pride in himself, and his jealousy of others, were
not more conspicuous than his thirst after riches. His fees as
Chancellor were reckoned by Giustinian at five thousand ducats a year.
He made thrice that sum by New Year's presents, "which he receives
like the
King".<a id="footnotetag312" name="footnotetag312"></a><a href="#footnote312">[312]</a>
His demand for the Bishopric of Bath and Wells,
coupled with the fact that it was he who petitioned for Hadrian's
deprivation, amazed even the Court at Rome, and, "to avoid
murmurs,"<a id="footnotetag313" name="footnotetag313"></a><a href="#footnote313">[313]</a>
compliance was deferred for a time. But these scruples
were allowed no more than ecclesiastical law to stand in the way of
Wolsey's preferment. One of the small reforms decreed by the Lateran
Council was that no bishoprics should be held <i>in commendam</i>; the ink
was scarcely dry when Wolsey asked <i>in commendam</i> for the see of the
recently conquered
Tournay.<a id="footnotetag314" name="footnotetag314"></a><a href="#footnote314">[314]</a>
Tournay was restored to France in
1518, but the Cardinal took care that he should not be the loser. A
<i>sine qua non</i> of the peace was that Francis should pay him an annual
pension of twelve thousand livres as compensation for the loss of a
bishopric of which he had never obtained
possession.<a id="footnotetag315" name="footnotetag315"></a><a href="#footnote315">[315]</a>
He drew
other pensions for political services, from both Francis and Charles;
and, from the Duke of Milan, he obtained the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span>
promise of ten
thousand ducats a year before Pace set out to recover the
duchy.<a id="footnotetag316" name="footnotetag316"></a><a href="#footnote316">[316]</a>
It is scarcely a matter for wonder that foreign diplomatists, and
Englishmen, too, should have accused Wolsey of spending the King's
money for his own profit, and have thought that the surest way of
winning his favour was by means of a
bribe.<a id="footnotetag317" name="footnotetag317"></a><a href="#footnote317">[317]</a>
When England, in
1521, sided with Charles against Francis, the Emperor bound himself to
make good to Wolsey all the sums he would lose by a breach with
France; and from that year onwards Charles paid&mdash;or owed&mdash;Wolsey
eighteen thousand livres a
year.<a id="footnotetag318" name="footnotetag318"></a><a href="#footnote318">[318]</a>
It was nine times the pensions
considered sufficient for the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk; and even
so it does not include the revenue Wolsey derived from two Spanish
bishoprics. These were not bribes in the sense that they affected
Wolsey's policy; they were well enough known to the King; to spoil the
Egyptians was considered fair game, and Henry was generous enough not
to keep all the perquisites of peace or war for himself.</p>

<p>Two years after the agreement with Charles, Ruthal, Bishop of Durham,
died, and Wolsey exchanged Bath and Wells for the richer see formerly
held by his political ally
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span>
and friend. But Winchester was
richer even than Durham; so when Fox followed Ruthal to the grave, in
1528, Wolsey exchanged the northern for the southern see, and begged
that Durham might go to his natural son, a youth of
eighteen.<a id="footnotetag319" name="footnotetag319"></a><a href="#footnote319">[319]</a>
All
these were held <i>in commendam</i> with the Archbishopric of York, but
they did not satisfy Wolsey; and, in 1521, he obtained the grant of
St. Albans, the greatest abbey in England. His palaces outshone in
splendour those of Henry himself, and few monarchs have been able to
display such wealth of plate as loaded the Cardinal's table. Wolsey is
supposed to have conceived vast schemes of ecclesiastical reform,
which time and opportunity failed him to
effect.<a id="footnotetag320" name="footnotetag320"></a><a href="#footnote320">[320]</a>
If he had ever
seriously set about the work, the first thing to be reformed would
have been his own ecclesiastical practice. He personified in himself
most of the clerical abuses of his age. Not merely an "unpreaching
prelate," he rarely said mass; his <i>commendams</i> and absenteeism were
alike violations of canon law. Three of the bishoprics he held he
never visited at all; York, which he had obtained fifteen years
before, he did not visit till the year of his death, and then through
no wish of his own. He was equally negligent of the vow of chastity;
he cohabited with the daughter of "one Lark," a relative of the Lark
who is mentioned in the correspondence of the time as "omnipotent"
with the Cardinal, and as resident
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span>
in his household.<a id="footnotetag321" name="footnotetag321"></a><a href="#footnote321">[321]</a> By
her he left two children, a
son,<a id="footnotetag322" name="footnotetag322"></a><a href="#footnote322">[322]</a>
for whom he obtained a deanery,
four archdeaconries, five prebends, and a chancellorship, and sought
the Bishopric of Durham, and a daughter who became a nun. The
accusation brought against him by the Duke of Buckingham and others,
of procuring objects for Henry's sensual appetite, is a scandal, to
which no credence would have been attached but for Wolsey's own moral
laxity, and the fact that the governor of Charles V. performed a
similar office.<a id="footnotetag323" name="footnotetag323"></a><a href="#footnote323">[323]</a></p>

<p>Repellent as was Wolsey's character in many respects, he was yet the
greatest, as he was the last, of the ecclesiastical statesmen who have
governed England. As a diplomatist, pure and simple, he has never been
surpassed, and as an administrator he has had few equals. "He is,"
says Giustinian, "very handsome, learned, extremely eloquent, of vast
ability and indefatigable. He alone transacts the same business as
that which occupies all the magistracies, offices, and councils of
Venice, both civil and criminal; and all State affairs are managed by
him, let their nature be what it may. He is thoughtful, and has the
reputation of being extremely just; he favours the people exceedingly,
and especially the poor, hearing their suits and seeking to despatch
them instantly. He also makes the lawyers plead gratis for all poor
suitors. He is in very great repute, seven times more so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>(p. 119)</span>
than if he were
Pope."<a id="footnotetag324" name="footnotetag324"></a><a href="#footnote324">[324]</a>
His sympathy with the poor was no idle
sentiment, and his commission of 1517, and decree against enclosures
in the following year, were the only steps taken in Henry's reign to
mitigate that curse of the agricultural population.</p>

<p>The Evil May Day riots of 1517 alone disturbed the peace of Wolsey's
internal administration; and they were due merely to anti-foreign
prejudice, and to the idea that strangers within the gates monopolised
the commerce of England and diverted its profits to their own
advantage. "Never," wrote Wolsey to a bishop at Rome in 1518, "was the
kingdom in greater harmony and repose than now; such is the effect of
my administration of justice and
equity."<a id="footnotetag325" name="footnotetag325"></a><a href="#footnote325">[325]</a>
To Henry his strain was
less arrogant. "And for your realm," he says, "our Lord be thanked, it
was never in such peace nor tranquillity; for all this summer I have
had neither of riot, felony, nor forcible entry, but that your laws be
in every place indifferently ministered without leaning of any manner.
Albeit, there hath lately been a fray betwixt Pygot, your Serjeant,
and Sir Andrew Windsor's servants for the seisin of a ward, whereto
they both pretend titles; in the which one man was slain. I trust the
next term to learn them the law of the Star Chamber that they shall
ware how from henceforth they shall redress their matter with their
hands. They be both learned in the temporal law, and I doubt not good
example shall ensue to see them learn the new law of the Star Chamber,
which, God willing, they shall have indifferently
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>(p. 120)</span>
administered to them, according to their
deserts."<a id="footnotetag326" name="footnotetag326"></a><a href="#footnote326">[326]</a></p>

<p>Wolsey's "new law of the Star Chamber," his stern enforcement of the
statutes against livery and maintenance, and his spasmodic attempt to
redress the evils of
enclosures,<a id="footnotetag327" name="footnotetag327"></a><a href="#footnote327">[327]</a>
probably contributed as much as
his arrogance and ostentation to the ill-favour in which he stood with
the nobility and landed gentry. From the beginning there were frequent
rumours of plots to depose him, and his enemies abroad often talked of
the universal hatred which he inspired in England. The classes which
benefited by his justice complained bitterly of the impositions
required to support his spirited foreign policy. Clerics who regarded
him as a bulwark on the one hand against heresy, and, on the other,
against the extreme view which Henry held from the first of his
authority over the Church, were alienated by the despotism Wolsey
wielded by means of his legatine powers. Even the mild and aged Warham
felt his lash, and was threatened with <i>Præmunire</i> for having wounded
Wolsey's legatine authority by calling a council at
Lambeth.<a id="footnotetag328" name="footnotetag328"></a><a href="#footnote328">[328]</a>
Peers, spiritual no less than temporal, regarded him as "the great
tyrant". Parliament he feared and distrusted; he had urged the speedy
dissolution of that of 1515; only one sat during the fourteen years of
his supremacy, and with that the Cardinal quarrelled. He possessed no
hold over the nation, but only over the King, in whom alone he put his
trust.</p>

<p>For
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>(p. 121)</span>
the time he seemed secure enough. No one could touch a
hair of his head so long as he was shielded by Henry's power, and
Henry seemed to have given over his royal authority to Wolsey's hands
with a blind and undoubting confidence. "The King," said one, in 1515,
"is a youngling, cares for nothing but girls and hunting, and wastes
his father's
patrimony."<a id="footnotetag329" name="footnotetag329"></a><a href="#footnote329">[329]</a>
"He gambled," reported Giustinian in
1519, "with the French hostages, occasionally, it was said, to the
amount of six or eight thousand ducats a
day."<a id="footnotetag330" name="footnotetag330"></a><a href="#footnote330">[330]</a>
In the following
summer Henry rose daily at four or five in the morning and hunted till
nine or ten at night; "he spares," said Pace, "no pains to convert the
sport of hunting into a
martyrdom".<a id="footnotetag331" name="footnotetag331"></a><a href="#footnote331">[331]</a>
"He devotes himself," wrote
Chieregati, "to accomplishments and amusements day and night, is
intent on nothing else, and leaves business to Wolsey, who rules
everything."<a id="footnotetag332" name="footnotetag332"></a><a href="#footnote332">[332]</a>
Wolsey, it was remarked by Leo X., made Henry go
hither and thither, just as he
liked,<a id="footnotetag333" name="footnotetag333"></a><a href="#footnote333">[333]</a>
and the King signed State
papers without knowing their contents. "Writing," admitted Henry, "is
to me somewhat tedious and
painful."<a id="footnotetag334" name="footnotetag334"></a><a href="#footnote334">[334]</a>
When Wolsey thought it
essential that autograph letters in Henry's hand should be sent to
other crowned heads, he composed the letters and sent them to Henry to
copy out.<a id="footnotetag335" name="footnotetag335"></a><a href="#footnote335">[335]</a>
Could the most constitutional monarch have been more
dutiful? But constitutional monarchy was not then invented, and it is
not surprising that Giustinian, in 1519, found it impossible to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span>
say much for Henry as a statesman. <i>Agere cum rege</i>, he said,
<i>est nihil
agere</i>;<a id="footnotetag336" name="footnotetag336"></a><a href="#footnote336">[336]</a>
anything told to the King was either useless
or was communicated to Wolsey. Bishop West was sure that Henry would
not take the pains to look at his and Worcester's despatches; and
there was a widespread impression abroad and at home that the English
King was a negligible quantity in the domestic and foreign affairs of
his own kingdom.</p>

<p>For ten years Henry had reigned while first his council, and then
Wolsey, governed. Before another decade had passed, Henry was King and
Government in one; and nobody in the kingdom counted for much but the
King. He stepped at once into Wolsey's place, became his own prime
minister, and ruled with a vigour which was assuredly not less than
the Cardinal's. Such transformations are not the work of a moment, and
Henry's would have been impossible, had he in previous years been so
completely the slave of Vanity Fair, as most people thought. In
reality, there are indications that beneath the superficial gaiety of
his life, Henry was beginning to use his own judgment, form his own
conclusions, and take an interest in serious matters. He was only
twenty-eight in 1519, and his character was following a normal course
of development.</p>

<p>From the earliest years of his reign Henry had at least two serious
preoccupations, the New Learning and his navy. We learn from Erasmus
that Henry's Court was an example to Christendom for learning and
piety;<a id="footnotetag337" name="footnotetag337"></a><a href="#footnote337">[337]</a>
that the King sought to promote learning among the clergy;
and on one occasion defended "mental and <i>ex tempore</i> prayer" against
those who apparently thought laymen should,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>(p. 123)</span>
in their private
devotions, confine themselves to formularies prescribed by the
clergy.<a id="footnotetag338" name="footnotetag338"></a><a href="#footnote338">[338]</a>
In 1519 there were more men of learning at the English
Court than at any
university;<a id="footnotetag339" name="footnotetag339"></a><a href="#footnote339">[339]</a>
it was more like a museum, says the
great humanist, than a
Court;<a id="footnotetag340" name="footnotetag340"></a><a href="#footnote340">[340]</a>
and in the same year the King
endeavoured to stop the outcry against Greek, raised by the
reactionary "Trojans" at Oxford. "You would say," continues Erasmus,
"that Henry was a universal genius. He has never neglected his
studies; and whenever he has leisure from his political occupations,
he reads, or disputes&mdash;of which he is very fond&mdash;with remarkable
courtesy and unruffled temper. He is more of a companion than a king.
For these little trials of wit, he prepares himself by reading
schoolmen, Thomas, Scotus or
Gabriel."<a id="footnotetag341" name="footnotetag341"></a><a href="#footnote341">[341]</a>
His theological studies
were encouraged by Wolsey, possibly to divert the King's mind from an
unwelcome interference in politics, and it was at the Cardinal's
instigation that Henry set to work on his famous book against
Luther.<a id="footnotetag342" name="footnotetag342"></a><a href="#footnote342">[342]</a>
He seems to have begun it, or some similar treatise,
which may afterwards have been adapted to Luther's particular case,
before the end of the year in which the German reformer published his
original theses. In September, 1517, Erasmus heard that Henry had
returned to his
studies,<a id="footnotetag343" name="footnotetag343"></a><a href="#footnote343">[343]</a>
and, in the following June, Pace writes
to Wolsey that, with respect to the commendations given by the
Cardinal to the King's book, though Henry does not think it worthy
such great praise as it has had from him and from all other "great
learned"
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>(p. 124)</span>
men, yet he says he is very glad to have "noted in
your grace's letters that his reasons be called inevitable,
considering that your grace was sometime his adversary herein and of
contrary
opinion".<a id="footnotetag344" name="footnotetag344"></a><a href="#footnote344">[344]</a>
It is obvious that this "book," whatever it
may have been, was the fruit of Henry's own mind, and that he adopted
a line of argument not entirely relished by Wolsey. But, if it was the
book against Luther, it was laid aside and rewritten before it was
given to the world in its final form. Nothing more is heard of it for
three years. In April, 1521, Pace explains to Wolsey the delay in
sending him on some news-letters from Germany "which his grace had not
read till this day after his dinner; and thus he commanded me to write
unto your grace, declaring he was otherwise occupied; <i>i.e., in
scribendo contra Lutherum,</i> as I do
conjecture".<a id="footnotetag345" name="footnotetag345"></a><a href="#footnote345">[345]</a>
Nine days later
Pace found the King reading a new book of Luther's, "which he
dispraised"; and he took the opportunity to show Henry Leo's bull
against the Reformer. "His grace showed himself well contented with
the coming of the same; howbeit, as touching the publication thereof,
he said he would have it well examined and diligently looked to afore
it were
published."<a id="footnotetag346" name="footnotetag346"></a><a href="#footnote346">[346]</a>
Even in the height of his fervour against
heresy, Henry was in no mood to abate one jot or one tittle of his
royal authority in ecclesiastical matters.</p>

<p>His book was finished before 21st May, 1521, when the King wrote to
Leo, saying that "ever since he knew Luther's heresy in Germany, he
had made it his study how to extirpate it. He had called the learned
of his kingdom to consider these errors and denounce them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>(p. 125)</span>
exhort others to do the same. He had urged the Emperor and
Electors, since this pestilent fellow would not return to God, to
extirpate him and his heretical books. He thought it right still
further to testify his zeal for the faith by his writings, that all
might see he was ready to defend the Church, not only with his arms,
but with the resources of his mind. He dedicated therefore, to the
Pope, the first offerings of his intellect and his little
erudition."<a id="footnotetag347" name="footnotetag347"></a><a href="#footnote347">[347]</a>
The letter had been preceded, on 12th May, by a
holocaust of Luther's books in St. Paul's Churchyard. Wolsey sat in
state on a scaffold at St. Paul's Cross, with the papal nuncio and the
Archbishop of Canterbury at his feet on the right, and the imperial
ambassador and Tunstall, Bishop of London, at his feet on the left;
and while the books were being devoured by the flames, Fisher preached
a sermon denouncing the errors contained
therein.<a id="footnotetag348" name="footnotetag348"></a><a href="#footnote348">[348]</a>
But it was July
before the fair copy of Henry's book was ready for presentation to
Leo; possibly the interval was employed by learned men in polishing
Henry's style, but the substance of the work was undoubtedly of
Henry's authorship. Such is the direct testimony of Erasmus, and there
is no evidence to indicate the collaboration of
others.<a id="footnotetag349" name="footnotetag349"></a><a href="#footnote349">[349]</a>
Pace was
then the most intimate of Henry's counsellors, and Pace, by his own
confession, was not in the secret. Nor is the book so remarkable as to
preclude the possibility of Henry's authorship. Its arguments are
respectable and give evidence of an intelligent and fairly extensive
acquaintance with the writings of the fathers and schoolmen; but they
reveal no profound depth of theological learning nor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>(p. 126)</span>
genius
for abstract speculation. It does not rank so high in the realm of
theology, as do some of Henry's compositions in that of music. In
August it was sent to Leo, with verses composed by Wolsey and copied
out in the royal
hand.<a id="footnotetag350" name="footnotetag350"></a><a href="#footnote350">[350]</a>
In September the English ambassador at
Rome presented Leo his copy, bound in cloth of gold. The Pope read
five leaves without interruption, and remarked that "he would not have
thought such a book should have come from the King's grace, who hath
been occupied, necessarily, in other feats, seeing that other men
which hath occupied themselves in study all their lives cannot bring
forth the
like".<a id="footnotetag351" name="footnotetag351"></a><a href="#footnote351">[351]</a>
On 2nd October it was formally presented in a
consistory of cardinals; and, on the 11th, Leo promulgated his bull
conferring on Henry his coveted title, "Fidei Defensor".</p>

<p>Proud as he was of his scholastic achievement and its reward at the
hands of the Pope, Henry was doing more for the future of England by
his attention to naval affairs than by his pursuit of high-sounding
titles. His intuitive perception of England's coming needs in this
respect is, perhaps, the most striking illustration of his political
foresight. He has been described as the father of the British navy;
and, had he not laid the foundations of England's naval power, his
daughter's victory over Spain and entrance on the path that led to
empire would have been impossible. Under Henry, the navy was first
organised as a permanent force; he founded the royal dockyards at
Woolwich and Deptford, and the corporation of Trinity
House;<a id="footnotetag352" name="footnotetag352"></a><a href="#footnote352">[352]</a> he
encouraged the planting of timber for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>(p. 127)</span>
shipbuilding, enacted
laws facilitating inland navigation, dotted the coast with
fortifications, and settled the constitution of the naval service upon
a plan from which it has ever since steadily developed. He owed his
inspiration to none of his councillors, least of all to Wolsey, who
had not the faintest glimmering of the importance of securing
England's naval supremacy, and who, during the war of 1522-23,
preferred futile invasions on land to Henry's "secret designs" for
destroying the navy of
France.<a id="footnotetag353" name="footnotetag353"></a><a href="#footnote353">[353]</a>
The King's interest in ships and
shipbuilding was strong, even amid the alluring diversions of the
first years of his reign. He watched his fleet sail for Guienne in
1512, and for France in 1513; he knew the speed, the tonnage and the
armament of every ship in his navy; he supervised the minutest details
of their construction. In 1520 his ambassador at Paris tells him that
Francis is building a ship, "and reasoneth in this mystery of
shipman's craft as one which had understanding in the same. But, sir,
he approacheth not your highness in that
science."<a id="footnotetag354" name="footnotetag354"></a><a href="#footnote354">[354]</a>
A French envoy
records how, in 1515, the whole English Court went down to see the
launch of the <i>Princess Mary</i>. Henry himself "acted as pilot and wore
a sailor's coat and trousers, made of cloth of gold, and a gold chain
with the inscription, 'Dieu <i>est</i> mon droit,' to which was suspended a
whistle, which he blew nearly as loud as a
trumpet".<a id="footnotetag355" name="footnotetag355"></a><a href="#footnote355">[355]</a>
The launch
of a ship was then almost a religious ceremony, and the place of the
modern bottle of champagne was taken by a mass, which was said by the
Bishop of Durham. In 1518 Giustinian tells how Henry went to
Southampton to see the Venetian galleys,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>(p. 128)</span>
and caused some new
guns to be "fired again and again, marking their range, as he is very
curious about matters of this
kind".<a id="footnotetag356" name="footnotetag356"></a><a href="#footnote356">[356]</a></p>

<p>It was not long before Henry developed an active participation in
serious matters other than theological disputes and naval affairs. It
is not possible to trace its growth with any clearness because no
record remains of the verbal communications which were sufficient to
indicate his will during the constant attendance of Wolsey upon him.
But, as soon as monarch and minister were for some cause or another
apart, evidence of Henry's activity in political matters becomes more
available. Thus, in 1515, we find Wolsey sending the King, at his own
request, the Act of Apparel, just passed by Parliament, for Henry's
"examination and
correction".<a id="footnotetag357" name="footnotetag357"></a><a href="#footnote357">[357]</a>
He also desires Henry's
determination about the visit of the Queen of Scotland, that he may
make the necessary arrangements. In 1518 Henry made a prolonged stay
at Abingdon, partly from fear of the plague, and partly, as he told
Pace, because at Abingdon people were not continually coming to tell
him of deaths, as they did daily in London. During this absence from
London, Henry insisted upon the attendance of sufficient councillors
to enable him to transact business; he established a relay of posts
every seven hours between himself and Wolsey; and we hear of his
reading "every word of all the letters" sent by his
minister.<a id="footnotetag358" name="footnotetag358"></a><a href="#footnote358">[358]</a>
Every week Wolsey despatched an account of such State business as he
had transacted; and on one occasion, "considering the importance of
Wolsey's letters," Henry paid a secret and flying visit to
London.<a id="footnotetag359" name="footnotetag359"></a><a href="#footnote359">[359]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>(p. 129)</span>
In 1519 there was a sort of revolution at
Court, obscure enough now, but then a subject of some comment at home
and abroad. Half a dozen of Henry's courtiers were removed from his
person and sent into honourable exile, receiving posts at Calais, at
Guisnes, and
elsewhere.<a id="footnotetag360" name="footnotetag360"></a><a href="#footnote360">[360]</a>
Giustinian thought that Henry had been
gambling too much and wished to turn over a new leaf. There were also
rumours that these courtiers governed Henry after their own appetite,
to the King's dishonour; and Henry, annoyed at the report and jealous
as ever of royal prestige, promptly cashiered them, and filled their
places with grave and reverend seniors.</p>

<p>Two years later Wolsey was abroad at the conference of Calais, and
again Henry's hand in State affairs becomes apparent. Pace, defending
himself from the Cardinal's complaints, tells him that he had done
everything "by the King's express commandment, who readeth all your
letters with great diligence". One of the letters which angered Wolsey
was the King's, for Pace "had devised it very different"; but the King
would not approve of it; "and commanded me to bring your said letters
into his privy chamber with pen and ink, and there he would declare
unto me what I should write. And when his grace had your said letters,
he read the same three times, and marked such places as it pleased him
to make answer unto, and commanded me to write and rehearse as liked
him, and not further to meddle with that answer; so that I herein
nothing did but obeyed the King's commandment,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>(p. 130)</span>
and
especially at such time <i>as he would upon good grounds be obeyed,
whosoever spake to the
contrary</i>."<a id="footnotetag361" name="footnotetag361"></a><a href="#footnote361">[361]</a>
Wolsey might say in his pride
"I shall do so and so," and foreign envoys might think that the
Cardinal made the King "go hither and thither, just as he liked"; but
Wolsey knew perfectly well that when he thought fit, Henry "would be
obeyed, whosoever spake to the contrary". He might delegate much of
his authority, but men were under no misapprehension that he could and
would revoke it whenever he chose. For the time being, King and
Cardinal worked together in general harmony, but it was a partnership
in which Henry could always have the last word, though Wolsey did most
of the work. As early as 1518 he had nominated Standish to the
bishopric of St. Asaph, disregarding Wolsey's candidate and the
opposition of the clerical party at Court, who detested Standish for
his advocacy of Henry's authority in ecclesiastical matters, and
dreaded his promotion as an evil omen for the independence of the
Church.<a id="footnotetag362" name="footnotetag362"></a><a href="#footnote362">[362]</a></p>

<p>Even in the details of administration, the King was becoming
increasingly vigilant. In 1519 he drew up a "remembrance of such
things" as he required the Cardinal to "put in effectual
execution".<a id="footnotetag363" name="footnotetag363"></a><a href="#footnote363">[363]</a>
They were twenty-one in number and ranged over every
variety of subject. The household was to be arranged; "views to be
made and books kept"; the ordnance seen to; treasurers were to make
monthly reports of their receipts and payments, and send counterparts
to the King; the surveyor of lands was to make a yearly declaration;
and Wolsey
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>(p. 131)</span>
himself and the judges were to make quarterly
reports to Henry in person. There were five points "which the King
will debate with his council," the administration of justice, reform
of the exchequer, Ireland, employment of idle people, and maintenance
of the frontiers. The general plan of Wolsey's negotiations at Calais
in 1521 was determined by King and Cardinal in consultation, and every
important detail in them and in the subsequent preparations for war
was submitted to Henry. Not infrequently they differed. Wolsey wanted
Sir William Sandys to command the English contingent; Henry declared
it would be inconsistent with his dignity to send a force out of the
realm under the command of any one of lower rank than an earl. Wolsey
replied that Sandys would be cheaper than an
earl,<a id="footnotetag364" name="footnotetag364"></a><a href="#footnote364">[364]</a>
but the
command was entrusted to the Earl of Surrey. Henry thought it unsafe,
considering the imminence of a breach with France, for English wine
ships to resort to Bordeaux; Wolsey thought otherwise, and they
disputed the point for a month. Honours were divided; the question was
settled for the time by twenty ships sailing while the dispute was in
progress.<a id="footnotetag365" name="footnotetag365"></a><a href="#footnote365">[365]</a>
Apparently they returned in safety, but the seizure of
English ships at Bordeaux in the following March justified Henry's
caution.<a id="footnotetag366" name="footnotetag366"></a><a href="#footnote366">[366]</a>
The King was already an adept in statecraft, and there
was at least an element of truth in the praise which Wolsey bestowed
on his pupil. "No man," he wrote, "can more groundly consider the
politic governance of your said realm, nor more assuredly look to the
preservation thereof, than ye yourself." And again, "surely, if all
<i>your</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>(p. 132)</span>
whole council had been assembled together, they could
not have more deeply perceived or spoken
therein".<a id="footnotetag367" name="footnotetag367"></a><a href="#footnote367">[367]</a></p>

<p>The Cardinal "could not express the joy and comfort with which he
noted the King's prudence"; but he can scarcely have viewed Henry's
growing interference without some secret misgivings. For he was
developing not only Wolsey's skill and lack of scruple in politics,
but also a choleric and impatient temper akin to the Cardinal's own.
In 1514 Carroz had complained of Henry's offensive behaviour, and had
urged that it would become impossible to control him, if the "young
colt" were not bridled. In the following year Henry treated a French
envoy with scant civility, and flatly contradicted him twice as he
described the battle of Marignano. Giustinian also records how Henry
went "pale with anger" at unpleasant
news.<a id="footnotetag368" name="footnotetag368"></a><a href="#footnote368">[368]</a>
A few years later his
successor describes Henry's "very great rage" when detailing Francis's
injuries; Charles made the same complaints against the French King,
"but not so angrily, in accordance with his gentler
nature".<a id="footnotetag369" name="footnotetag369"></a><a href="#footnote369">[369]</a>
On
another occasion Henry turned his back upon a diplomatist and walked
away in the middle of his speech, an incident, we are told, on which
much comment was made in
Rome.<a id="footnotetag370" name="footnotetag370"></a><a href="#footnote370">[370]</a></p>

<p>But these outbursts were rare and they grew rarer; in 1527 Mendoza,
the Spanish ambassador, remarks that it was "quite the reverse of the
King's ordinary manner" to be more violent than
Wolsey;<a id="footnotetag371" name="footnotetag371"></a><a href="#footnote371">[371]</a>
and
throughout the period of strained relations with the Emperor, Chapuys
constantly refers to the unfailing courtesy and graciousness with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>(p. 133)</span>
which Henry received him. He never forgot himself so far as to
lay rude hands on an ambassador, as Wolsey did; and no provocation
betrayed him in his later years, passionate though he was, into a
neglect of the outward amenities of diplomatic and official
intercourse. Outbursts of anger, of course, there were; but they were
often like the explosions of counsel in law courts, and were "to a
great extent diplomatically
controlled".<a id="footnotetag372" name="footnotetag372"></a><a href="#footnote372">[372]</a>
Nor can we deny the
consideration with which Henry habitually treated his councillors, the
wide discretion he allowed them in the exercise of their duties, and
the toleration he extended to contrary opinions. He was never
impatient of advice even when it conflicted with his own views. His
long arguments with Wolsey, and the freedom with which the Cardinal
justified his recommendations, even after Henry had made up his mind
to an opposite course, are a sufficient proof of the fact. In 1517,
angered by Maximilian's perfidy, Henry wrote him some very
"displeasant" letters. Tunstall thought they would do harm, kept them
back, and received no censure for his conduct. In 1522-23 Wolsey
advised first the siege of Boulogne and then its abandonment. "The
King," wrote More, "is by no means displeased that you have changed
your opinion, as his highness esteemeth nothing in counsel more
perilous than one to persevere in the maintenance of his advice
because he hath once given it. He therefore commendeth and most
affectuously thanketh your faithful diligence and high wisdom in
advertising him of the reasons which have moved you to change your
opinion."<a id="footnotetag373" name="footnotetag373"></a><a href="#footnote373">[373]</a>
No king knew better than Henry how to get good work
from his ministers, and his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>(p. 134)</span>
warning against persevering in
advice, merely because it has once been given, is a political maxim
for all time.</p>

<p>A lesson might also be learnt from a story of Henry and Colet told by
Erasmus on Colet's own
authority.<a id="footnotetag374" name="footnotetag374"></a><a href="#footnote374">[374]</a>
In 1513 war fever raged in
England. Colet's bishop summoned him "into the King's Court for
asserting, when England was preparing for war against France, that an
unjust peace was preferable to the most just war; but the King
threatened his persecutor with vengeance. After Easter, when the
expedition was ready against France, Colet preached on Whitsunday
before the King and the Court, exhorting men rather to follow the
example of Christ their prince than that of Cæsar and Alexander. The
King was afraid that this sermon would have an ill effect upon the
soldiers and sent for the Dean. Colet happened to be dining at the
Franciscan monastery near Greenwich. When the King heard of it, he
entered the garden of the monastery, and on Colet's appearance
dismissed his attendants; then discussed the matter with him, desiring
him to explain himself, lest his audience should suppose that no war
was justifiable. After the conversation was over he dismissed him
before them all, drinking to Colet's health and saying 'Let every man
have his own doctor, this is mine'." The picture is pleasing evidence
of Henry's superiority to some vulgar passions. Another instance of
freedom from popular prejudice, which he shared with his father, was
his encouragement of foreign scholars, diplomatists and merchants; not
a few of the ablest of Tudor agents were of alien birth. He was
therefore intensely annoyed at the rabid fury against them that broke
out in the riots of Evil
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>(p. 135)</span>
May Day; yet he pardoned all the
ringleaders but one. Tolerance and clemency were no small part of his
character in early
manhood;<a id="footnotetag375" name="footnotetag375"></a><a href="#footnote375">[375]</a>
and together with his other mental
and physical graces, his love of learning and of the society of
learned men, his magnificence and display, his supremacy in all the
sports that were then considered the peculiar adornment of royalty,
they contributed scarcely less than Wolsey's genius for diplomacy and
administration to England's renown. "In short," wrote Chieregati to
Isabella d'Este in 1517, "the wealth and civilisation of the world are
here; and those who call the English barbarians appear to me to render
themselves such. I here perceive very elegant manners, extreme
decorum, and very great politeness. And amongst other things there is
this most invincible King, whose accomplishments and qualities are so
many and excellent that I consider him to surpass all who ever wore a
crown; and blessed and happy may this country call itself in having as
its lord so worthy and eminent a sovereign; whose sway is more bland
and gentle than the greatest liberty under any
other."<a id="footnotetag376" name="footnotetag376"></a><a href="#footnote376">[376]</a></p>




<h3>CHAPTER VI.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>(p. 136)</span></h3>

<h4>FROM CALAIS TO ROME.</h4>


<p>The wonderful success that had attended Wolsey's policy during his
seven years' tenure of power, and the influential position to which he
had raised England in the councils of Christendom, might well have
disturbed the mental balance of a more modest and diffident man than
the Cardinal; and it is scarcely surprising that he fancied himself,
and sought to become, arbiter of the destinies of Europe. The
condition of continental politics made his ambition seem less than
extravagant. Power was almost monopolised by two young princes whose
rivalry was keen, whose resources were not altogether unevenly
matched, and whose disputes were so many and serious that war could
only be averted by a pacific determination on both sides which neither
possessed. Francis had claims on Naples, and his dependant, D'Albret,
on Navarre. Charles had suzerain rights over Milan and a title to
Burgundy, of which his great-grandfather Charles the Bold had been
despoiled by Louis XI. Yet the Emperor had not the slightest intention
of compromising his possession of Naples or Navarre, and Francis was
quite as resolute to surrender neither Burgundy nor Milan. They both
became eager competitors for the friendship of England, which, if its
resources were inadequate to support the position
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>(p. 137)</span> of
arbiter, was at least a most useful makeweight. England's choice of
policy was, however, strictly limited. She could not make war upon
Charles. It was not merely that Charles had a staunch ally in his aunt
Catherine of Aragon, who is said to have "made such representations
and shown such reasons against" the alliance with Francis "as one
would not have supposed she would have dared to do, or even to
imagine".<a id="footnotetag377" name="footnotetag377"></a><a href="#footnote377">[377]</a>
It was not merely that in this matter Catherine was
backed by the whole council except Wolsey, and by the real
inclinations of the King. It was that the English people were firmly
imperialist in sympathy. The reason was obvious. Charles controlled
the wool-market of the Netherlands, and among English exports wool was
all-important. War with Charles meant the ruin of England's export
trade, the starvation or impoverishment of thousands of Englishmen;
and when war was declared against Charles eight years later, it more
nearly cost Henry his throne than all the fulminations of the Pope or
religious discontents, and after three months it was brought to a
summary end. England remained at peace with Spain so long as Spain
controlled its market for wool; when that market passed into the hands
of the revolted Netherlands, the same motive dictated an alliance with
the Dutch against Philip II. War with Charles in 1520 was out of the
question; and for the next two years Wolsey and Henry were
endeavouring to make Francis and the Emperor bid against each other,
in order that England might obtain the maximum of concession from
Charles
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>(p. 138)</span>
when it should declare in his favour, as all along
was intended.</p>

<p>By the Treaty of London Henry was bound to assist the aggrieved
against the aggressor. But that treaty had been concluded between
England and France in the first instance; Henry's only daughter was
betrothed to the Dauphin; and Francis was anxious to cement his
alliance with Henry by a personal
interview.<a id="footnotetag378" name="footnotetag378"></a><a href="#footnote378">[378]</a>
It was Henry's
policy to play the friend for the time; and, as a proof of his desire
for the meeting with Francis, he announced, in August, 1519, his
resolve to wear his beard until the meeting took
place.<a id="footnotetag379" name="footnotetag379"></a><a href="#footnote379">[379]</a> He
reckoned without his wife. On 8th November Louise of Savoy, the
queen-mother of France, taxed Boleyn, the English ambassador, with a
report that Henry had put off his beard. "I said," writes Boleyn,
"that, as I suppose, it hath been by the Queen's desire; for I told my
lady that I have hereafore time known when the King's grace hath worn
long his beard, that the Queen hath daily made him great instance, and
desired him to put it off for her
sake."<a id="footnotetag380" name="footnotetag380"></a><a href="#footnote380">[380]</a>
Henry's inconstancy in
the matter of his beard not only caused diplomatic inconvenience, but,
it may be parenthetically remarked, adds to the difficulty of dating
his portraits. Francis, however, considered the Queen's interference a
sufficient excuse, or was not inclined to stick at such trifles; and
on 10th January, 1520, he nominated Wolsey his proctor to make
arrangements for the
interview.<a id="footnotetag381" name="footnotetag381"></a><a href="#footnote381">[381]</a>
As Wolsey was also agent for
Henry, the French King saw no further cause for delay.</p>

<p>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>(p. 139)</span>
delay came from England; the meeting with Francis would
be a one-sided pronouncement without some corresponding favour to
Charles. Some time before Henry had sent Charles a pressing invitation
to visit England on his way from Spain to Germany; and the Emperor,
suspicious of the meeting between Henry and Francis, was only too
anxious to come and forestall it. The experienced Margaret of Savoy
admitted that Henry's friendship was essential to
Charles;<a id="footnotetag382" name="footnotetag382"></a><a href="#footnote382">[382]</a>
but
Spaniards were not to be hurried, and it would be May before the
Emperor's convoy was ready. So Henry endeavoured to postpone his
engagement with Francis. The French King replied that by the end of
May his Queen would be in the eighth month of her pregnancy, and that
if the meeting were further prorogued she must perforce be
absent.<a id="footnotetag383" name="footnotetag383"></a><a href="#footnote383">[383]</a>
Henry was nothing if not gallant, at least on the
surface. Francis's argument clinched the matter. The interview,
ungraced by the presence of France's Queen, would, said Henry, be
robbed of most of its
charm;<a id="footnotetag384" name="footnotetag384"></a><a href="#footnote384">[384]</a>
and he gave Charles to understand
that, unless he reached England by the middle of May, his visit would
have to be cancelled. This intimation produced an unwonted despatch in
the Emperor's movements; but fate was against him, and contrary winds
rendered his arrival in time a matter of doubt till the last possible
moment. Henry must cross to Calais on the 31st of May, whether Charles
came or not; and it was the 26th before the Emperor's ships appeared
off the cliffs of Dover. Wolsey put out in a small boat to meet him,
and conducted Charles to the castle where he lodged. During
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>(p. 140)</span>
the night Henry arrived. Early next day, which was Whitsunday, the two
sovereigns proceeded to Canterbury, where the Queen and Court had come
on the way to France to spend their Pentecost. Five days the Emperor
remained with his aunt, whom he now saw for the first time; but the
days were devoted to business rather than to elaborate ceremonial and
show, for which there had been little time to
prepare.<a id="footnotetag385" name="footnotetag385"></a><a href="#footnote385">[385]</a></p>

<p>On the last day of May Charles took ship at Sandwich for Flanders.
Henry embarked at Dover for France. The painting at Hampton Court
depicting the scene has, like almost every other picture of Henry's
reign, been ascribed to Holbein; but six years were to pass before the
great artist visited England. The King himself is represented as being
on board the four-masted <i>Henry Grace à Dieu</i>, commonly called the
<i>Great Harry</i>, the finest ship afloat; though the vessel originally
fitted out for his passage was the <i>Katherine
Pleasaunce</i>.<a id="footnotetag386" name="footnotetag386"></a><a href="#footnote386">[386]</a>
At
eleven o'clock he landed at Calais. On Monday, the 4th of June, Henry
and all his Court proceeded to Guisnes. There a temporary palace of
art had been erected, the splendour of which is inadequately set forth
in pages upon pages of contemporary descriptions. One Italian likened
it to the palaces described in Boiardo's <i>Orlando Innamorato</i> and
Ariosto's <i>Orlando Furioso</i>; another declared that it could not have
been better designed by Leonardo da Vinci
himself.<a id="footnotetag387" name="footnotetag387"></a><a href="#footnote387">[387]</a>
Everything was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>(p. 141)</span>
in harmony with this architectural pomp. Wolsey was
accompanied, it was said in Paris, by two hundred gentlemen clad in
crimson velvet, and had a body-guard of two hundred archers. He was
himself clothed in crimson satin from head to foot, his mule was
covered with crimson velvet, and her trappings were all of gold.
Henry, "the most goodliest prince that ever reigned over the realm of
England," appeared even to Frenchmen as a very handsome prince,
"honnête, hault et
droit,"<a id="footnotetag388" name="footnotetag388"></a><a href="#footnote388">[388]</a>
in manner gentle and gracious, rather
fat, and&mdash;in spite of his Queen&mdash;with a red beard, large enough and
very becoming. Another eye-witness adds the curious remark that, while
Francis was the taller of the two, Henry had the handsomer and more
<i>feminine</i>
face!<a id="footnotetag389" name="footnotetag389"></a><a href="#footnote389">[389]</a>
On the 7th of June the two Kings started
simultaneously from Guisnes and Ardres for their personal meeting in
the valley mid-way between the two towns, already known as the Val
Doré. The obscure but familiar phrase, Field of Cloth of
Gold,<a id="footnotetag390" name="footnotetag390"></a><a href="#footnote390">[390]</a> is
a mistranslation of the French Camp du Drap d'Or. As they came in
sight a temporary suspicion of French designs seized the English, but
it was overcome. Henry and Francis rode forward alone, embraced each
other first on horseback and then again on foot, and made show of
being the closest friends in Christendom. On Sunday the 10th Henry
dined with the French Queen, and Francis with Catherine of Aragon. The
following week was devoted to tourneys, which the two Kings opened by
holding the field against all comers. The official accounts are
naturally silent on the royal wrestling
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span>
match, recorded in
French memoirs and
histories.<a id="footnotetag391" name="footnotetag391"></a><a href="#footnote391">[391]</a>
On the 17th Francis, as a final
effort to win Henry's alliance, paid a surprise visit to him at
breakfast with only four attendants. The jousts were concluded with a
solemn mass said by Wolsey in a chapel built on the field. The
Cardinal of Bourbon presented the Gospel to Francis to kiss; he
refused, offering it to Henry who was too polite to accept the honour.
The same respect for each other's dignity was observed with the <i>Pax</i>,
and the two Queens behaved with a similarly courteous punctilio. After
a friendly dispute as to who should kiss the <i>Pax</i> first, they kissed
each other
instead.<a id="footnotetag392" name="footnotetag392"></a><a href="#footnote392">[392]</a>
On the 24th Henry and Francis met to
interchange gifts, to make their final professions of friendship, and
to bid each other adieu. Francis set out for Abbeville, and Henry
returned to Calais.</p>

<p>The Field of Cloth of Gold was the last and most gorgeous display of
the departing spirit of chivalry; it was also perhaps the most
portentous deception on record. "These sovereigns," wrote a Venetian,
"are not at peace. They adapt themselves to circumstances, but they
hate each other very
cordially."<a id="footnotetag393" name="footnotetag393"></a><a href="#footnote393">[393]</a>
Beneath the profusion of
friendly pretences lay rooted suspicions and even deliberate hostile
intentions. Before Henry left England the rumour of ships fitting out
in French ports had stopped preparations for the interview; and they
were not resumed till a promise under the broad seal of France was
given that no French ship should sail before Henry's
return.<a id="footnotetag394" name="footnotetag394"></a><a href="#footnote394">[394]</a> On
the eve of the meeting Henry is said to have discovered that three or
four thousand French troops were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>(p. 143)</span>
concealed in the
neighbouring
country;<a id="footnotetag395" name="footnotetag395"></a><a href="#footnote395">[395]</a>
he insisted on their removal, and Francis's
unguarded visit to Henry was probably designed to disarm the English
distrust.<a id="footnotetag396" name="footnotetag396"></a><a href="#footnote396">[396]</a>
No sooner was Henry's back turned than the French began
the fortification of
Ardres,<a id="footnotetag397" name="footnotetag397"></a><a href="#footnote397">[397]</a>
while Henry on his part went to
Calais to negotiate a less showy but genuine friendship with Charles.
No such magnificence adorned their meeting as had been displayed at
the Field of Cloth of Gold, but its solid results were far more
lasting. On 10th July Henry rode to Gravelines where the Emperor was
waiting. On the 11th they returned together to Calais, where during a
three days' visit the negotiations begun at Canterbury were completed.
The ostensible purport of the treaty signed on the 14th was to bind
Henry to proceed no further in the marriage between the Princess Mary
and the Dauphin, and Charles no further in that between himself and
Francis's daughter,
Charlotte.<a id="footnotetag398" name="footnotetag398"></a><a href="#footnote398">[398]</a>
But more topics were discussed
than appeared on the surface; and among them was a proposal to marry
Mary to the Emperor
himself.<a id="footnotetag399" name="footnotetag399"></a><a href="#footnote399">[399]</a>
The design proves that Henry and
Wolsey had already made up their minds to side with Charles, whenever
his disputes with Francis should develop into open hostilities.</p>

<p>That consummation could not be far off. Charles had scarcely turned
his back upon Spain when murmurs of disaffection were heard through
the length and breadth of the land; and while he was discussing with
Henry at Calais the prospects of a war with France, his commons in
Spain broke out into open
revolt.<a id="footnotetag400" name="footnotetag400"></a><a href="#footnote400">[400]</a>
The rising had attained
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>(p. 144)</span>
such dimensions by February, 1521, that Henry thought Charles was
likely to lose his Spanish dominions. The temptation was too great for
France to resist; and in the early spring of 1521 French forces
overran Navarre, and restored to his kingdom the exile D'Albret.
Francis had many plausible excuses, and sought to prove that he was
not really the aggressor. There had been confused fighting between the
imperialist Nassau and Francis's allies, the Duke of Guelders and
Robert de la Marck, which the imperialists may have begun. But Francis
revealed his true motive, when he told Fitzwilliam that he had many
grievances against Charles and could not afford to neglect this
opportunity for taking his
revenge.<a id="footnotetag401" name="footnotetag401"></a><a href="#footnote401">[401]</a></p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>War between Emperor and King soon spread from Navarre to the borders
of Flanders and to the plains of Northern Italy. Both sovereigns
claimed the assistance of England in virtue of the Treaty of London.
But Henry would not be prepared for war till the following year at
least; and he proposed that Wolsey should go to Calais to mediate
between the two parties and decide which had been the aggressor.
Charles, either because he was unprepared or was sure of Wolsey's
support, readily agreed; but Francis was more reluctant, and only the
knowledge that, if he refused, Henry would at once side with Charles,
induced him to consent to the conference. So on 2nd August, 1521, the
Cardinal again crossed the
Channel.<a id="footnotetag402" name="footnotetag402"></a><a href="#footnote402">[402]</a>
His first interview was with
the imperial
envoys.<a id="footnotetag403" name="footnotetag403"></a><a href="#footnote403">[403]</a>
They announced that Charles had given them
no power to treat for a truce. Wolsey refused to proceed without this
authority;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>(p. 145)</span>
and he obtained the consent of the French
chancellor, Du Prat, to his proposal to visit the Emperor at Bruges,
and secure the requisite powers. He was absent more than a fortnight,
and not long after his return fell ill. This served to pass time in
September, and the extravagant demands of both parties still further
prolonged the proceedings. Wolsey was constrained to tell them the
story of a courtier who asked his King for the grant of a forest; when
his relatives denounced his presumption, he replied that he only
wanted in reality eight or nine
trees.<a id="footnotetag404" name="footnotetag404"></a><a href="#footnote404">[404]</a>
The French and imperial
chancellors not merely demanded their respective forests, but made the
reduction of each single tree a matter of lengthy dispute; and as soon
as a fresh success in the varying fortune of war was reported, they
returned to their early pretensions. Wolsey was playing his game with
consummate skill; delay was his only desire; his illness had been
diplomatic; his objects were to postpone for a few months the breach
and to secure the pensions from France due at the end of
October.<a id="footnotetag405" name="footnotetag405"></a><a href="#footnote405">[405]</a></p>

<p>The conference at Calais was in fact a monument of perfidy worthy of
Ferdinand the Catholic. The plan was Wolsey's, but Henry had expressed
full approval. As early as July the King was full of his secret design
for destroying the navy of France, though he did not propose to
proceed with the enterprise till Wolsey had completed the arrangements
with
Charles.<a id="footnotetag406" name="footnotetag406"></a><a href="#footnote406">[406]</a>
The subterfuge about
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>(p. 146)</span>
Charles refusing his
powers and the Cardinal's journey to Bruges had been arranged between
Henry, Wolsey and Charles before Wolsey left England. The object of
that visit, so far from being to facilitate an agreement, was to
conclude an offensive and defensive alliance against one of the two
parties between whom Wolsey was pretending to mediate. "Henry agrees,"
wrote Charles's ambassador on 6th July, "with Wolsey's plan that he
should be sent to Calais under colour of hearing the grievances of
both parties: and when he cannot arrange them, he should withdraw to
the Emperor to treat of the matters
aforesaid".<a id="footnotetag407" name="footnotetag407"></a><a href="#footnote407">[407]</a>
The treaty was
concluded at Bruges on 25th
August<a id="footnotetag408" name="footnotetag408"></a><a href="#footnote408">[408]</a>
before he returned to Calais;
the Emperor promised Wolsey the
Papacy;<a id="footnotetag409" name="footnotetag409"></a><a href="#footnote409">[409]</a>
the details of a joint
invasion were settled. Charles was to marry Mary; and the Pope was to
dispense the two from the disability of their kinship, and from
engagements with others which both had contracted. The Cardinal might
be profuse in his protestations of friendship for France, of devotion
to peace, and of his determination to do justice to the parties before
him. But all his painted words could not long conceal the fact that
behind the mask of the judge were hidden the features of a
conspirator. It was an unpleasant time for Fitzwilliam, the English
ambassador at the French Court. The King's sister, Marguerite de
Valois, taxed Fitzwilliam with Wolsey's proceedings, hinting that
deceit was being practised on Francis.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>(p. 147)</span>
The ambassador grew
hot, vowed Henry was not a dissembler, and that he would prove it on
any gentleman who dared to maintain that he
was.<a id="footnotetag410" name="footnotetag410"></a><a href="#footnote410">[410]</a>
But he knew
nothing of Wolsey's intrigues; nor was the Cardinal, to whom
Fitzwilliam denounced the insinuation, likely to blush, though he knew
that the charge was true.</p>

<p>Wolsey returned from Calais at the end of November, having failed to
establish the truce to which the negotiations had latterly been in
appearance directed. But the French half-yearly pensions were paid,
and England had the winter in which to prepare for war. No attempt had
been made to examine impartially the mutual charges of aggression
urged by the litigants, though a determination of that point could
alone justify England's intervention. The dispute was complicated
enough. If, as Charles contended, the Treaty of London guaranteed the
<i>status quo</i>, Francis, by invading Navarre, was undoubtedly the
offender. But the French King pleaded the Treaty of Noyon, by which
Charles had bound himself to do justice to the exiled King of Navarre,
to marry the French King's daughter, and to pay tribute for Naples.
That treaty was not abrogated by the one concluded in London, yet
Charles had fulfilled none of his promises. Moreover, the Emperor
himself had, long before the invasion of Navarre, been planning a war
with France, and negotiating with Leo to expel the French from Milan,
and to destroy the predominant French faction in
Genoa.<a id="footnotetag411" name="footnotetag411"></a><a href="#footnote411">[411]</a> His
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>(p. 148)</span>
ministers were making little secret of Charles's warlike
intentions, when the Spanish revolt placed irresistible temptation in
Francis's way, and provoked that attack on Navarre, which enabled
Charles to plead, with some colour, that he was not the aggressor.
This was the ground alleged by Henry for siding with Charles, but it
was not his real reason for going to war. Nearly a year before Navarre
was invaded, he had discussed the rupture of Mary's engagement with
the Dauphin and the transference of her hand to the Emperor.</p>

<p>The real motives of England's policy do not appear on the surface.
"The aim of the King of England," said Clement VII. in
1524,<a id="footnotetag412" name="footnotetag412"></a><a href="#footnote412">[412]</a> "is
as incomprehensible as the causes by which he is moved are futile. He
may, perhaps, wish to revenge himself for the slights he has received
from the King of France and from the Scots, or to punish the King of
France for his disparaging language; or, seduced by the flattery of
the Emperor, he may have nothing else in view than to help the
Emperor; or he may, perhaps, really wish to preserve peace in Italy,
and therefore declares himself an enemy of any one who disturbs it. It
is even not impossible that the King of England expects to be rewarded
by the Emperor after the victory, and hopes, perhaps, to get
Normandy." Clement three years before, when Cardinal de Medici, had
admitted that he knew little of English
politics;<a id="footnotetag413" name="footnotetag413"></a><a href="#footnote413">[413]</a>
and his
ignorance may explain his inability to give a more satisfactory reason
for Henry's conduct than these tentative and far-fetched suggestions.
But after the publication of Henry's State papers, it is not easy to
arrive at any more definite conclusion. The only motive Wolsey
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>(p. 149)</span>
alleges, besides the <i>ex post facto</i> excuses of Francis's
conduct, is the recovery of Henry's rights to the crown of France; and
if this were the real object, it reduces both King and Cardinal to the
level of political charlatans. To conquer France was a madcap scheme,
when Henry himself was admitting the impossibility of raising 30,000
foot or 10,000 horse, without hired contingents from Charles's
domains;<a id="footnotetag414" name="footnotetag414"></a><a href="#footnote414">[414]</a>
when, according to Giustinian, it would have been hard
to levy 100 men-at-arms or 1000 light cavalry in the whole
island;<a id="footnotetag415" name="footnotetag415"></a><a href="#footnote415">[415]</a>
when the only respectable military force was the archers,
already an obsolete arm. Invading hosts could never be victualled for
more than three months, or stand a winter campaign; English troops
were ploughmen by profession and soldiers only by chance; Henry VII.'s
treasure was exhausted, and efforts to raise money for fitful and
futile inroads nearly produced a revolt. Henry VIII. himself was
writing that to provide for these inroads would prevent him keeping an
army in Ireland; and Wolsey was declaring that for the same reason
English interests in Scotland must take care of themselves, that
border warfare must be confined to the strictest defensive, and that a
"cheap" deputy must be found for Ireland, who would rule it, like
Kildare, without English
aid.<a id="footnotetag416" name="footnotetag416"></a><a href="#footnote416">[416]</a>
It is usual to lay the folly of the
pretence to the crown of France at Henry's door. But it is a curious
fact that when Wolsey was gone, and Henry was his own prime minister,
this spirited foreign policy took a very subordinate place, and Henry
turned his attention to the cultivation of his own garden instead of
seeking to annex
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>(p. 150)</span>
his neighbour's. It is possible that he was
better employed in wasting his people's blood and treasure in the
futile devastation of France, than in placing his heel on the Church
and sending Fisher and More to the scaffold; but his attempts to
reduce Ireland to order, and to unite England and Scotland, violent
though his methods may have been, were at least more sane than the
quest for the crown of France, or even for the possession of
Normandy.<a id="footnotetag417" name="footnotetag417"></a><a href="#footnote417">[417]</a></p>

<p>Yet if these were not Wolsey's aims, what were his motives? The
essential thing for England was the maintenance of a fairly even
balance between Francis and Charles; and if Wolsey thought that would
best be secured by throwing the whole of England's weight into the
Emperor's scale, he must have strangely misread the political
situation. He could not foresee, it may be said, the French debacle.
If so, it was from no lack of omens. Even supposing he was ignorant,
or unable to estimate the effects, of the moral corruption of Francis,
the peculations of his mother Louise of Savoy, the hatred of the war,
universal among the French lower classes, there were definite warnings
from more careful
observers.<a id="footnotetag418" name="footnotetag418"></a><a href="#footnote418">[418]</a>
As early as 1517 there were bitter
complaints in France of the <i>gabelle</i> and other taxes, and a Cordelier
denounced the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>(p. 151)</span>
French King as worse than
Nero.<a id="footnotetag419" name="footnotetag419"></a><a href="#footnote419">[419]</a>
In 1519
an anonymous Frenchman wrote that Francis had destroyed his own
people, emptied his kingdom of money, and that the Emperor or some
other would soon have a cheap bargain of the kingdom, for he was more
unsteady on his throne than people
thought.<a id="footnotetag420" name="footnotetag420"></a><a href="#footnote420">[420]</a>
Even the treason of
Bourbon, which contributed so much to the French King's fall, was
rumoured three years before it occurred, and in 1520 he was known to
be "playing the
malcontent".<a id="footnotetag421" name="footnotetag421"></a><a href="#footnote421">[421]</a>
At the Field of Cloth of Gold Henry
is said to have told Francis that, had he a subject like Bourbon, he
would not long leave his head on his
shoulders.<a id="footnotetag422" name="footnotetag422"></a><a href="#footnote422">[422]</a>
All these details
were reported to the English Government and placed among English
archives; and, indeed, at the English Court the general anticipation,
justified by the event, was that Charles would carry the day.</p>

<p>No possible advantage could accrue to England from such a destruction
of the balance of power; her position as mediator was only tenable so
long as neither Francis nor Charles had the complete mastery. War on
the Emperor was, no doubt, out of the question, but that was no reason
for war on France. Prudence counselled England to make herself strong,
to develop her resources, and to hold her strength in reserve, while
the two rivals weakened each other by war. She would then be in a far
better position to make her voice heard in the settlement, and would
probably have been able to extract from it all the benefits she could
with reason or justice demand. So obvious was the advantage of this
policy that for some time acute French statesmen refused to credit
Wolsey
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>(p. 152)</span>
with any other. They said, reported an English envoy
to the Cardinal, "that your grace would make your profit with them and
the Emperor both, and proceed between them so that they might continue
in war, and that the one destroy the other, and the King's highness
may remain and be their arbiter and
superior".<a id="footnotetag423" name="footnotetag423"></a><a href="#footnote423">[423]</a>
If it is urged
that Henry was bent on the war, and that Wolsey must satisfy the King
or forfeit his power, even the latter would have been the better
alternative. His fall would have been less complete and more
honourable than it actually was. Wolsey's failure to follow this
course suggests that, by involving Henry in dazzling schemes of a
foreign conquest, he was seeking to divert his attention from urgent
matters at home; that he had seen a vision of impending ruin; and that
his actions were the frantic efforts of a man to turn a steed, over
which he has imperfect control, from the gulf he sees yawning ahead.
The only other explanation is that Wolsey sacrificed England's
interests in the hope of securing from Charles the gift of the papal
tiara.<a id="footnotetag424" name="footnotetag424"></a><a href="#footnote424">[424]</a></p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>However that may be, it was not for Clement VII. to deride England's
conduct. The keen-sighted Pace had remarked in 1521 that, in the event
of Charles's victory, the Pope would have to look to his affairs in
time.<a id="footnotetag425" name="footnotetag425"></a><a href="#footnote425">[425]</a>
The Emperor's triumph was, indeed, as fatal to the Papacy
as it was to Wolsey. Yet Clement VII., on whom the full force of the
blow was to fall, had, as Cardinal de Medici, been one of the chief
promoters of the war. In August, 1521,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>(p. 153)</span>
the Venetian,
Contarini, reports Charles as saying that Leo rejected both the peace
and the truce speciously urged by Wolsey, and adds, on his own
account, that he believes it the
truth.<a id="footnotetag426" name="footnotetag426"></a><a href="#footnote426">[426]</a>
In 1522 Francis asserted
that Cardinal de Medici "was the cause of all this
war";<a id="footnotetag427" name="footnotetag427"></a><a href="#footnote427">[427]</a>
and in
1527 Clement VII. sought to curry favour with Charles by declaring
that as Cardinal de Medici he had in 1521 caused Leo X. to side
against
France.<a id="footnotetag428" name="footnotetag428"></a><a href="#footnote428">[428]</a>
In 1525 Charles declared that he had been mainly
induced to enter on the war by the persuasions of
Leo,<a id="footnotetag429" name="footnotetag429"></a><a href="#footnote429">[429]</a>
over whom
his cousin, the Cardinal, then wielded supreme influence. So complete
was his sway over Leo, that, on Leo's death, a cardinal in the
conclave remarked that they wanted a new Pope, not one who had already
been Pope for years; and the gibe turned the scale against the future
Clement VII. Medici both, Leo and the Cardinal regarded the Papacy
mainly as a means for family aggrandisement. In 1518 Leo had
fulminated against Francis Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, as "the
son of iniquity and child of
perdition,"<a id="footnotetag430" name="footnotetag430"></a><a href="#footnote430">[430]</a>
because he desired to
bestow the duchy on his nephew Lorenzo. In the family interest he was
withholding Modena and Reggio from Alfonso d'Este, and casting envious
eyes on Ferrara. In March, 1521, the French marched to seize some
Milanese exiles, who were harboured at
Reggio.<a id="footnotetag431" name="footnotetag431"></a><a href="#footnote431">[431]</a>
Leo took the
opportunity to form an alliance with Charles for the expulsion of
Francis from Italy. It was signed at Worms on the 8th of May, the day
on which Luther was
outlawed;<a id="footnotetag432" name="footnotetag432"></a><a href="#footnote432">[432]</a>
and a war broke
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>(p. 154)</span>
out in
Italy, the effects of which were little foreseen by its principal
authors. A veritable Nemesis attended this policy conceived in perfidy
and greed. The battle of Pavia made Charles more nearly dictator of
Europe than any ruler has since been, except Napoleon Bonaparte. It
led to the sack of Rome and the imprisonment of Clement VII. by
Charles's troops. The dependence of the Pope on the Emperor made it
impossible for Clement to grant Henry's petition for divorce, and his
failure to obtain the divorce precipitated Wolsey's fall.</p>

<p>Leo, meanwhile, had gone to his account on the night of 1st-2nd
December, 1521, singing "Nunc dimittis" for the expulsion of the
French from
Milan;<a id="footnotetag433" name="footnotetag433"></a><a href="#footnote433">[433]</a>
and amid the clangour of war the cardinals met
to choose his successor. Their spirit belied their holy profession.
"All here," wrote Manuel, Charles's representative, "is founded on
avarice and
lies;"<a id="footnotetag434" name="footnotetag434"></a><a href="#footnote434">[434]</a>
and again "there cannot be so much hatred and
so many devils in hell as among these cardinals". "The Papacy is in
great decay" echoed the English envoy Clerk, "the cardinals brawl and
scold; their malicious, unfaithful and uncharitable demeanour against
each other increases every
day."<a id="footnotetag435" name="footnotetag435"></a><a href="#footnote435">[435]</a>
Feeling between the French and
imperial factions ran high, and the only question was whether an
adherent of Francis or Charles would secure election. Francis had
promised Wolsey fourteen French votes; but after the conference of
Calais he would have been forgiving indeed had he wielded his
influence on behalf of the English candidate. Wolsey
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>(p. 155)</span>
built
more upon the promise of Charles at
Bruges;<a id="footnotetag436" name="footnotetag436"></a><a href="#footnote436">[436]</a>
but, if he really
hoped for Charles's assistance, his sagacity was greatly to seek. The
Emperor at no time made any effort on Wolsey's behalf; he did him the
justice to think that, were Wolsey elected, he would be devoted more
to English than to imperial interests; and he preferred a Pope who
would be undividedly imperialist at heart. Pace was sent to join Clerk
at Rome in urging Wolsey's suit, and they did their best; but English
influence at the Court of Rome was infinitesimal. In spite of
Campeggio's flattering assurance that Wolsey's name appeared in every
scrutiny, and that sometimes he had eight or nine votes, and Clerk's
statement that he had nine at one time, twelve at another, and
nineteen at a
third,<a id="footnotetag437" name="footnotetag437"></a><a href="#footnote437">[437]</a>
Wolsey's name only appears in one of the
eleven scrutinies, and then he received but seven out of eighty-one
votes.<a id="footnotetag438" name="footnotetag438"></a><a href="#footnote438">[438]</a>
The election was long and keenly contested. The conclave
commenced on the 28th of December, and it was not till the 9th of
January, 1522, that the cardinals, conscious of each other's defects,
agreed to elect an absentee, about whom they knew little. Their choice
fell on Adrian, Cardinal of Tortosa; and it is significant of the
extent of Charles's influence, that the new Pope had been his tutor,
and was proposed as a candidate by the imperial ambassador on the day
that the conclave
opened.<a id="footnotetag439" name="footnotetag439"></a><a href="#footnote439">[439]</a></p>

<p>Neither the expulsion of the French from Milan, nor the election of
Charles's tutor as Pope, opened Wolsey's eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>(p. 156)</span>
to the danger
of further increasing the Emperor's
power.<a id="footnotetag440" name="footnotetag440"></a><a href="#footnote440">[440]</a>
He seems rather to
have thrown himself into the not very chivalrous design of completing
the ruin of the weaker side, and picking up what he could from the
spoils. During the winter of 1521-22 he was busily preparing for war,
while endeavouring to delay the actual breach till his plans were
complete. Francis, convinced of England's hostile intentions, let
Albany loose upon Scotland and refused to pay the pensions to Henry
and Wolsey. They made these grievances the excuse for a war on which
they had long been determined. In March Henry announced that he had
taken upon himself the protection of the Netherlands during Charles's
impending visit to Spain. Francis asserted that this was a plain
declaration of war, and seized the English wine-ships at Bordeaux. But
he was determined not to take the formal offensive, and, in May,
Clarencieux herald proceeded to France to bid him
defiance.<a id="footnotetag441" name="footnotetag441"></a><a href="#footnote441">[441]</a>
In
the following month Charles passed through England on his way to the
south, and fresh treaties were signed for the invasion of France, for
the marriage of Mary and for the extirpation of heresy. At
Windsor<a id="footnotetag442" name="footnotetag442"></a><a href="#footnote442">[442]</a>
Wolsey constituted his legatine court to bind the
contracting parties by oaths enforced by ecclesiastical censures. He
arrogated to himself a function usually reserved for the Pope, and
undertook to arbitrate between Charles and Henry if disputes arose
about the observance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>(p. 157)</span>
of their engagements. But he obviously
found difficulty in raising either money or men; and one of the
suggestions at Windsor was that a "dissembled peace" or a two years'
truce should be made with France, to give England time for more
preparations for war.</p>

<p>Nothing came of this last nefarious suggestion. In July Surrey
captured and burnt
Morlaix;<a id="footnotetag443" name="footnotetag443"></a><a href="#footnote443">[443]</a>
but, as he wrote from on board the
<i>Mary Rose</i>, Fitzwilliam's ships were without flesh or fish, and
Surrey himself had only beer for twelve days. Want of victuals
prevented further naval successes, and, in September, Surrey was sent
into Artois, where the same lack of organisation was equally fatal. It
did not, however, prevent him from burning farms and towns wherever he
went; and his conduct evoked from the French commander a just rebuke
of his "foul
warfare".<a id="footnotetag444" name="footnotetag444"></a><a href="#footnote444">[444]</a>
Henry himself was responsible; for Wolsey
wrote on his behalf urging the destruction of Dourlens and the
adjacent
towns.<a id="footnotetag445" name="footnotetag445"></a><a href="#footnote445">[445]</a>
If Henry really sought to make these territories
his own, it was an odd method of winning the affections and developing
the wealth of the subjects he hoped to acquire. Nothing was really
accomplished except devastation in France. Even this useless warfare
exhausted English energies, and left the Borders defenceless against
one of the largest armies ever collected in Scotland. Wolsey and Henry
were only saved, from what might have been a most serious invasion, by
Dacre's dexterity and Albany's cowardice. Dacre, the warden of the
marches, signed a truce without waiting for instructions, and before
it expired the Scots army disbanded. Henry and Wolsey might reprimand
Dacre for acting on his own responsibility, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>(p. 158)</span>
they knew
well enough that Dacre had done them magnificent
service.<a id="footnotetag446" name="footnotetag446"></a><a href="#footnote446">[446]</a></p>

<p>The results of the war from the English point of view had as yet been
contemptible, but great things were hoped for the following year.
Bourbon, Constable of France, and the most powerful peer in the
kingdom, intent on the betrayal of Francis, was negotiating with Henry
and Charles the price of his
treason.<a id="footnotetag447" name="footnotetag447"></a><a href="#footnote447">[447]</a>
The commons in France, worn
to misery by the taxes of Francis and the ravages of his enemies, were
eager for anything that might promise some alleviation of their lot.
They would even, it appears, welcome a change of dynasty; everywhere,
Henry was told, they cried "Vive le roi
d'Angleterre!"<a id="footnotetag448" name="footnotetag448"></a><a href="#footnote448">[448]</a>
Never,
said Wolsey, would there be a better opportunity for recovering the
King's right to the French crown; and Henry exclaimed that he trusted
to treat Francis as his father did Richard III. "I pray God," wrote
Sir Thomas More to Wolsey, "if it be good for his grace and for this
realm, that then it may prove so, and else in the stead thereof, I
pray God send his grace an honourable and profitable
peace."<a id="footnotetag449" name="footnotetag449"></a><a href="#footnote449">[449]</a> He
could scarcely go further in hinting his preference for peace to the
fantastic design which now occupied the minds of his masters. Probably
his opinion of the war was not far from that of old Bishop Fox, who
declared: "I have determined, and, betwixt God and me, utterly
renounced the meddling with worldly matters, specially concerning war
or anything to it appertaining (whereof, for the many intolerable
enormities
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>(p. 159)</span>
that I have seen ensue by the said war in time
past, I have no little remorse in my conscience), thinking that if I
did continual penance for it all the days of my life, though I should
live twenty years longer than I may do, I could not yet make
sufficient recompense therefor. And now, my good lord, to be called to
fortifications of towns and places of war, or to any matter concerning
the war, being of the age of seventy years and above, and looking
daily to die, the which if I did, being in any such meddling of the
war, I think I should die in
despair."<a id="footnotetag450" name="footnotetag450"></a><a href="#footnote450">[450]</a>
Protests like this and
hints like More's were little likely to move the militant Cardinal,
who hoped to see the final ruin of France in 1523. Bourbon was to
raise the standard of revolt, Charles was to invade from Spain and
Suffolk from Calais. In Italy French influence seemed irretrievably
ruined. The Genoese revolution, planned before the war, was effected;
and the persuasions of Pace and the threats of Charles at last
detached Venice and Ferrara from the alliance of
France.<a id="footnotetag451" name="footnotetag451"></a><a href="#footnote451">[451]</a></p>

<p>The usual delays postponed Suffolk's invasion till late in the year.
They were increased by the emptiness of Henry's treasury. His father's
hoard had melted away, and it was absolutely necessary to obtain
lavish supplies from Parliament. But Parliament proved ominously
intractable. Thomas Cromwell, now rising to notice, in a temperate
speech urged the folly of indulging in impracticable schemes of
foreign conquest, while Scotland remained a thorn in England's
side.<a id="footnotetag452" name="footnotetag452"></a><a href="#footnote452">[452]</a>
It was three months from the meeting of Parliament before
the subsidies were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>(p. 160)</span>
granted, and nearly the end of August
before Suffolk crossed to Calais with an army, "the largest which has
passed out of this realm for a hundred
years".<a id="footnotetag453" name="footnotetag453"></a><a href="#footnote453">[453]</a>
Henry and Suffolk
wanted it to besiege Boulogne, which might have been some tangible
result in English
hands.<a id="footnotetag454" name="footnotetag454"></a><a href="#footnote454">[454]</a>
But the King was persuaded by Wolsey and
his imperial allies to forgo this scheme, and to order Suffolk to
march into the heart of France. Suffolk was not a great general, but
he conducted the invasion with no little skill, and desired to conduct
it with unwonted humanity. He wished to win the French by abstaining
from pillage and proclaiming liberty, but Henry thought only the hope
of plunder would keep the army
together.<a id="footnotetag455" name="footnotetag455"></a><a href="#footnote455">[455]</a>
Waiting for the imperial
contingent under De Buren, Suffolk did not leave Calais till 19th
September. He advanced by Bray, Roye and Montdidier, capturing all the
towns that offered resistance. Early in November, he reached the Oise
at a point less than forty miles from the French
capital.<a id="footnotetag456" name="footnotetag456"></a><a href="#footnote456">[456]</a>
But
Bourbon's treason had been discovered; instead of joining Suffolk with
a large force, he was a fugitive from his country. Charles contented
himself with taking
Fuentarabia,<a id="footnotetag457" name="footnotetag457"></a><a href="#footnote457">[457]</a>
and made no effort at invasion.
The imperial contingent with Suffolk's army went home; winter set in
with unexampled severity, and Vendôme
advanced.<a id="footnotetag458" name="footnotetag458"></a><a href="#footnote458">[458]</a>
The English were
compelled to retire; their retreat was effected without loss, and by
the middle of December the army was back at Calais. Suffolk is
represented as being in disgrace for this retreat, and Wolsey as
saving him from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>(p. 161)</span>
effects of his
failure.<a id="footnotetag459" name="footnotetag459"></a><a href="#footnote459">[459]</a>
But even
Wolsey can hardly have thought that an army of twenty-five thousand
men could maintain itself in the heart of France, throughout the
winter, without support and with unguarded communications. The Duke's
had been the most successful invasion of France since the days of
Henry V. from a military point of view. That its results were negative
is due to the policy by which it was directed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was another papal election. Adrian, one of the most
honest and unpopular of Popes, died on 14th September, 1523, and by
order of the cardinals there was inscribed on his tomb: <i>Hic jacet
Adrianus Sextus cui nihil in vita infelicius contigit quam quod
imperaret.</i> With equal malice and keener wit the Romans erected to his
physician, Macerata, a statue with the title <i>Liberatori
Patriæ</i>.<a id="footnotetag460" name="footnotetag460"></a><a href="#footnote460">[460]</a>
Wolsey was again a candidate. He told Henry he would rather continue
in his service than be ten
Popes.<a id="footnotetag461" name="footnotetag461"></a><a href="#footnote461">[461]</a>
That did not prevent him
instructing Pace and Clerk to further his claims. They were to
represent to the cardinals Wolsey's "great experience in the causes of
Christendom, his favour with the Emperor, the King, and other princes,
his anxiety for Christendom, his liberality, the great promotions to
be vacated by his election, his frank, pleasant and courteous
inclinations, his freedom from all ties of family or party, and the
hopes of a great expedition against the
infidel".<a id="footnotetag462" name="footnotetag462"></a><a href="#footnote462">[462]</a>
Charles was, as
usual, profuse in his promise of aid. He actually wrote a letter in
Wolsey's favour; but he took the precaution to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>(p. 162)</span>
detain the
bearer in Spain till the election was
over.<a id="footnotetag463" name="footnotetag463"></a><a href="#footnote463">[463]</a>
He had already
instructed his minister at Rome to procure the election of Cardinal de
Medici. That ambassador mocked at Wolsey's hopes; "as if God," he
wrote, "would perform a miracle every
day".<a id="footnotetag464" name="footnotetag464"></a><a href="#footnote464">[464]</a>
The Holy Spirit, by
which the cardinals always professed to be moved, was not likely to
inspire the election of another absentee after their experience of
Adrian. Wolsey had not the remotest chance, and his name does not
occur in a single scrutiny. After the longest conclave on record, the
imperial influence prevailed; on 18th November De Medici was
proclaimed Pope, and he chose as his title Clement
VII.<a id="footnotetag465" name="footnotetag465"></a><a href="#footnote465">[465]</a></p>

<p>Suffolk's invasion was the last of England's active participation in
the war. Exhausted by her efforts, discontented with the Emperor's
failure to render assistance in the joint enterprise, or perceiving at
last that she had little to gain, and much to lose, from the overgrown
power of Charles, England, in 1524, abstained from action, and even
began to make overtures to Francis. Wolsey repaid Charles's inactivity
of the previous year by standing idly by, while the imperial forces
with Bourbon's contingent invaded Provence and laid siege to
Marseilles. But Francis still held command of the sea; the spirit of
his people rose with the danger; Marseilles made a stubborn and
successful defence; and, by October, the invading army was in headlong
retreat towards
Italy.<a id="footnotetag466" name="footnotetag466"></a><a href="#footnote466">[466]</a>
Had Francis been content with defending
his kingdom, all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>(p. 163)</span>
might have been well; but ambition lured
him on to destruction. He thought he had passed the worst of the
trouble, and that the prize of Milan might yet be his. So, before the
imperialists were well out of France, he crossed the Alps and sat down
to besiege Pavia. It was brilliantly defended by Antonio de Leyva. In
November Francis's ruin was thought to be certain; astrologers
predicted his death or
imprisonment.<a id="footnotetag467" name="footnotetag467"></a><a href="#footnote467">[467]</a>
Slowly and surely Pescara,
the most consummate general of his age, was pressing north with
imperial troops to succour Pavia. Francis would not raise the siege.
On 24th February, 1525, he was attacked in front by Pescara and in the
rear by De Leyva. "The victory is complete," wrote the Abbot of Najera
to Charles from the field of battle, "the King of France is made
prisoner.... The whole French army is annihilated.... To-day is feast
of the Apostle St. Mathias, on which, five and twenty years ago, your
Majesty is said to have been born. Five and twenty thousand times
thanks and praise to God for His mercy! Your Majesty is, from this
day, in a position to prescribe laws to Christians and Turks,
according to your
pleasure."<a id="footnotetag468" name="footnotetag468"></a><a href="#footnote468">[468]</a></p>

<p>Such was the result of Wolsey's policy since 1521, Francis a prisoner,
Charles a dictator, and Henry vainly hoping that he might be allowed
some share in the victor's spoils. But what claim had he? By the most
extraordinary misfortune or fatuity, England had not merely helped
Charles to a threatening supremacy, but had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>(p. 164)</span>
retired from the
struggle just in time to deprive herself of all claim to benefit by
her mistaken policy. She had looked on while Bourbon invaded France,
fearing to aid lest Charles would reap all the fruits of success. She
had sent no force across the channel to threaten Francis's rear. Not a
single French soldier had been diverted from attacking Charles in
Italy through England's interference. One hundred thousand crowns had
been promised the imperial troops, but the money was not paid; and
secret negotiations had been going on with France. In spite of all,
Charles had won, and he was naturally not disposed to divide the
spoils. England's policy since 1521 had been disastrous to herself, to
Wolsey, to the Papacy, and even to Christendom. For the falling out of
Christian princes seemed to the Turk to afford an excellent
opportunity for the faithful to come by his own. After an heroic
defence by the knights of St. John, Rhodes, the bulwark of
Christendom, had surrendered to Selim. Belgrade, the strongest citadel
in Eastern Europe, followed. In August, 1526, the King and the flower
of Hungarian nobility perished at the battle of Mohacz; and the
internecine strife of Christians seemed doomed to be sated only by
their common subjugation to the Turk.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>Henry and Wolsey began to pay the price of their policy at home as
well as abroad. War was no less costly for being ineffective, and it
necessitated demands on the purses of Englishmen, to which they had
long been unused. In the autumn of 1522 Wolsey was compelled to have
recourse to a loan from both spiritualty and
temporalty.<a id="footnotetag469" name="footnotetag469"></a><a href="#footnote469">[469]</a>
It seems
to have met with a response which,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>(p. 165)</span>
compared with later
receptions, may be described as almost cheerful. But the loan did not
go far, and before another six months had elapsed it was found
necessary to summon Parliament to make further
provision.<a id="footnotetag470" name="footnotetag470"></a><a href="#footnote470">[470]</a>
The
Speaker was Sir Thomas More, who did all he could to secure a
favourable reception of Wolsey's demands. An unwonted spirit of
independence animated the members; the debates were long and stormy;
and the Cardinal felt called upon to go down to the House of Commons,
and hector it in such fashion that even More was compelled to plead
its privileges. Eventually, some money was reluctantly granted; but it
too was soon swallowed up, and in 1525 Wolsey devised fresh
expedients. He was afraid to summon Parliament again, so he proposed
what he called an Amicable Grant. It was necessary, he said, for Henry
to invade France in person; if he went, he must go as a prince; and he
could not go as a prince without lavish supplies. So he required what
was practically a graduated income-tax. The Londoners resisted till
they were told that resistance might cost them their heads. In Suffolk
and elsewhere open insurrection broke out. It was then proposed to
withdraw the fixed ratio, and allow each individual to pay what he
chose as a benevolence. A common councillor of London promptly
retorted that benevolences were illegal by statute of Richard III.
Wolsey cared little for the constitution, and was astonished that any
one should quote the laws of a wicked usurper; but the common
councillor was a sound constitutionalist, if Wolsey was not. "An it
please your grace," he replied, "although King Richard did evil, yet
in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>(p. 166)</span>
his time were many good acts made, not by him only, but
by the consent of the body of the whole realm, which is
Parliament."<a id="footnotetag471" name="footnotetag471"></a><a href="#footnote471">[471]</a>
There was no answer; the demand was withdrawn. Never
had Henry suffered such a rebuff, and he never suffered the like
again. Nor was this all; the whole of London, Wolsey is reported to
have said, were traitors to
Henry.<a id="footnotetag472" name="footnotetag472"></a><a href="#footnote472">[472]</a>
Informations of "treasonable
words"&mdash;that ominous phrase&mdash;became
frequent.<a id="footnotetag473" name="footnotetag473"></a><a href="#footnote473">[473]</a>
Here, indeed, was a
contrast to the exuberant loyalty of the early years of Henry's reign.
The change may not have been entirely due to Wolsey, but he had been
minister, with a power which few have equalled, during the whole
period in which it was effected, and Henry may well have begun to
think that it was time for his removal.</p>

<p>Whether Wolsey was now anxious to repair his blunder by siding with
Francis against Charles, or to snatch some profit from the Emperor's
victory by completing the ruin of France, the refusal of Englishmen to
find more money for the war left him no option but peace. In April,
1525, Tunstall and Sir Richard Wingfield were sent to Spain with
proposals for the exclusion of Francis and his children from the
French throne and the dismemberment of his
kingdom.<a id="footnotetag474" name="footnotetag474"></a><a href="#footnote474">[474]</a>
It is
doubtful if Wolsey himself desired the fulfilment of so preposterous
and iniquitous a scheme. It is certain that Charles was in no mood to
abet it. He had no wish to extract profit for England out of the
abasement of Francis, to see Henry King of France, or lord of any
French provinces. He
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>(p. 167)</span>
had no intention of even performing his
part of the Treaty of Windsor. He had pledged himself to marry the
Princess Mary, and the splendour of that match may have contributed to
Henry's desire for an alliance with Charles. But another matrimonial
project offered the Emperor more substantial advantages. Ever since
1517 his Spanish subjects had been pressing him to marry the daughter
of Emmanuel, King of Portugal. The Portuguese royal family had claims
to the throne of Castile which would be quieted by Charles's marriage
with a Portuguese princess. Her dowry of a million crowns was, also,
an argument not to be lightly disregarded in Charles's financial
embarrassments; and in March, 1526, the Emperor's wedding with
Isabella of Portugal was solemnised.</p>

<p>Wolsey, on his part, was secretly negotiating with Louise of Savoy
during her son's imprisonment in Spain. In August, 1525, a treaty of
amity was signed, by which England gave up all its claims to French
territory in return for the promise of large sums of money to Henry
and his
minister.<a id="footnotetag475" name="footnotetag475"></a><a href="#footnote475">[475]</a>
The impracticability of enforcing Henry's
pretensions to the French crown or to French provinces, which had been
urged as excuses for squandering English blood and treasure, was
admitted, even when the French King was in prison and his kingdom
defenceless. But what good could the treaty do Henry or Francis?
Charles had complete control over his captive, and could dictate his
own terms. Neither the English nor the French King was in a position
to continue the war; and the English alliance with France could abate
no iota of the concessions which Charles extorted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span>
from
Francis in January, 1526, by the Treaty of
Madrid.<a id="footnotetag476" name="footnotetag476"></a><a href="#footnote476">[476]</a>
Francis
surrendered Burgundy; gave up his claims to Milan, Genoa and Naples;
abandoned his allies, the King of Navarre, the Duke of Guelders and
Robert de la Marck; engaged to marry Charles's sister Eleanor, the
widowed Queen of Portugal; and handed over his two sons to the Emperor
as hostages for the fulfilment of the treaty. But he had no intention
of keeping his promises. No sooner was he free than he protested that
the treaty had been extracted by force, and that his oath to keep it
was not binding. The Estates of France readily refused their assent,
and the Pope was, as usual, willing, for political reasons, to absolve
Francis from his oath. For the time being, consideration for the
safety of his sons and the hope of obtaining their release prevented
him from openly breaking with Charles, or listening to the proposals
for a marriage with the Princess Mary, held out as a bait by
Wolsey.<a id="footnotetag477" name="footnotetag477"></a><a href="#footnote477">[477]</a>
The Cardinal's object was merely to injure the Emperor as
much as he could without involving England in war; and by negotiations
for Mary's marriage, first with Francis, and then with his second son,
the Duke of Orléans, he was endeavouring to draw England and France
into a closer alliance. For similar reasons he was extending his
patronage to the Holy League, formed by Clement VII. between the
princes of Italy to liberate that distressful country from the grip of
the Spanish forces.</p>

<p>The policy of Clement, of Venice, and of other Italian States had been
characterised by as much blindness as that of England. Almost without
exception they had united, in 1523, to expel the French from Italy.
The result
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>(p. 169)</span>
was to destroy the balance of power south of the
Alps, and to deliver themselves over to a bondage more galling than
that from which they sought to escape. Clement himself had been
elected Pope by imperial influence, and the Duke of Sessa, Charles's
representative in Rome, described him as entirely the Emperor's
creature.<a id="footnotetag478" name="footnotetag478"></a><a href="#footnote478">[478]</a>
He was, wrote Sessa, "very reserved, irresolute, and
decides few things himself. He loves money and prefers persons who
know where to find it to any other kind of men. He likes to give
himself the appearance of being independent, but the result shows that
he is generally governed by
others."<a id="footnotetag479" name="footnotetag479"></a><a href="#footnote479">[479]</a>
Clement, however, after his
election, tried to assume an attitude more becoming the head of
Christendom than slavish dependence on Charles. His love for the
Emperor, he told Charles, had not diminished, but his hatred for
others had
disappeared;<a id="footnotetag480" name="footnotetag480"></a><a href="#footnote480">[480]</a>
and throughout 1524 he was seeking to
promote concord between Christian princes. His methods were
unfortunate; the failure of the imperial invasion of Provence and
Francis's passage of the Alps, convinced the Pope that Charles's star
was waning, and that of France was in the ascendant. "The Pope," wrote
Sessa to Charles V., "is at the disposal of the
conqueror."<a id="footnotetag481" name="footnotetag481"></a><a href="#footnote481">[481]</a> So,
on 19th January, 1525, a Holy League between Clement and Francis was
publicly proclaimed at Rome, and joined by most of the Italian
States.<a id="footnotetag482" name="footnotetag482"></a><a href="#footnote482">[482]</a>
It was almost the eve of Pavia.</p>

<p>Charles received the news of that victory with astonishing humility.
But he was not likely to forget that at the critical moment he had
been deserted by most of his Italian allies; and it was with fear and
trembling that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>(p. 170)</span>
the Venetian ambassador besought him to use
his victory with
moderation.<a id="footnotetag483" name="footnotetag483"></a><a href="#footnote483">[483]</a>
Their conduct could hardly lead them
to expect much from the Emperor's clemency. Distrust of his intentions
induced the Holy League to carry on desultory war with the imperial
troops; but mutual jealousies, the absence of effective aid from
England or France, and vacillation caused by the feeling that after
all it might be safer to accept the best terms they could obtain,
prevented the war from being waged with any effect. In September,
1526, Hugo de Moncada, the imperial commander, concerted with
Clement's bitter foes, the Colonnas, a means of overawing the Pope. A
truce was concluded, wrote Moncada, "that the Pope, having laid down
his arms, may be taken
unawares".<a id="footnotetag484" name="footnotetag484"></a><a href="#footnote484">[484]</a>
On the 19th he marched on Rome.
Clement, taken unawares, fled to the castle of St. Angelo; his palace
was sacked, St. Peter's rifled, and the host profaned. "Never," says
Casale, "was so much cruelty and
sacrilege."<a id="footnotetag485" name="footnotetag485"></a><a href="#footnote485">[485]</a></p>

<p>It was soon thrown into the shade by an outrage at which the whole
world stood aghast. Charles's object was merely to render the Pope his
obedient slave; neither God nor man, said Moncada, could resist with
impunity the Emperor's victorious
arms.<a id="footnotetag486" name="footnotetag486"></a><a href="#footnote486">[486]</a>
But he had little control
over his own irresistible forces. With no enemy to check them, with no
pay to content them, the imperial troops were ravaging, pillaging,
sacking cities and churches throughout Northern Italy without let or
hindrance.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>(p. 171)</span>
At length a sudden frenzy seized them to march
upon Rome. Moncada had shown them the way, and on 6th May, 1527, the
Holy City was taken by storm. Bourbon was killed at the first assault;
and the richest city in Christendom was given over to a motley,
leaderless horde of German, Spanish and Italian soldiery. The Pope
again fled to the castle of St. Angelo; and for weeks Rome endured an
orgy of sacrilege, blasphemy, robbery, murder and lust, the horrors of
which no brush could depict nor tongue recite. "All the churches and
the monasteries," says a cardinal who was present, "both of friars and
nuns, were sacked. Many friars were beheaded, even priests at the
altar; many old nuns beaten with sticks; many young ones violated,
robbed and made prisoners; all the vestments, chalices, silver, were
taken from the churches.... Cardinals, bishops, friars, priests, old
nuns, infants, pages and servants&mdash;the very poorest&mdash;were tormented
with unheard-of cruelties&mdash;the son in the presence of his father, the
babe in the sight of its mother. All the registers and documents of
the Camera Apostolica were sacked, torn in pieces, and partly
burnt."<a id="footnotetag487" name="footnotetag487"></a><a href="#footnote487">[487]</a>
"Having entered," writes an imperialist to Charles, "our
men sacked the whole Borgo and killed almost every one they found....
All the monasteries were rifled, and the ladies who had taken refuge
in them carried off. Every person was compelled by torture to pay a
ransom.... The ornaments of all the churches were pillaged and the
relics and other things thrown into the sinks and cesspools. Even the
holy places were sacked. The Church of St. Peter and the papal palace,
from the basement to the top, were turned into stables for horses....
Every one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>(p. 172)</span>
considers that it has taken place by the just
judgment of God, because the Court of Rome was so ill-ruled.... We are
expecting to hear from your Majesty how the city is to be governed and
whether the Holy See is to be retained or not. Some are of opinion it
should not continue in Rome, <i>lest the French King should make a
patriarch in his kingdom, and deny obedience to the said See, and the
King of England find all other Christian princes do the
same</i>."<a id="footnotetag488" name="footnotetag488"></a><a href="#footnote488">[488]</a></p>

<p>So low was brought the proud city of the Seven Hills, the holy place,
watered with the blood of the martyrs and hallowed by the steps of the
saints, the goal of the earthly pilgrim, the seat of the throne of the
Vicar of God. No Jew saw the abomination of desolation standing where
it ought not with keener anguish than the devout sons of the Church
heard of the desecration of Rome. If a Roman Catholic and an
imperialist could term it the just judgment of God, heretics and
schismatics, preparing to burst the bonds of Rome and "deny obedience
to the said See," saw in it the fulfilment of the woes pronounced by
St. John the Divine on the Rome of Nero, and by Daniel the Prophet on
Belshazzar's Babylon. Babylon the great was fallen, and become the
habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit; her ruler was
weighed in the balances and found wanting; his kingdom was divided and
given to kings and peoples who came, like the Medes and the Persians,
from the hardier realms of the North.</p>






<h3>CHAPTER VII.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>(p. 173)</span></h3>

<h4>THE ORIGIN OF THE DIVORCE.<a id="footnotetag489" name="footnotetag489"></a><a href="#footnote489">[489]</a></h4>

<p>Matrimonial discords have, from the days of Helen of Troy, been the
fruitful source of public calamities; and one of the most decisive
events in English history, the breach with the Church of Rome, found
its occasion in the divorce of Catherine of Aragon. Its origin has
been traced to various circumstances. On one hand, it is attributed to
Henry's passion for Anne Boleyn, on the other, to doubts of the
validity of Henry's marriage, raised by the Bishop of Tarbes in 1527,
while negotiating a matrimonial alliance between the Princess Mary and
Francis I. These are the two most popular theories, and both are
demonstrably
false.<a id="footnotetag490" name="footnotetag490"></a><a href="#footnote490">[490]</a>
Doubts of the legality of Henry's marriage
had existed long before the Bishop of Tarbes paid his visit to
England, and even before Anne Boleyn was born. They were urged, not
only on the eve of the completion of the marriage, but when it was
first suggested. In 1503, when Henry VII. applied to Julius II. for a
dispensation to enable his second son to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>(p. 174)</span>
marry his brother's
widow, the Pope replied that "the dispensation was a great matter; nor
did he well know, <i>prima facie</i>, if it were competent for the Pope to
dispense in such a
case".<a id="footnotetag491" name="footnotetag491"></a><a href="#footnote491">[491]</a>
He granted the dispensation, but the
doubts were not entirely removed. Catherine's confessor instilled them
into her mind, and was recalled by Ferdinand on that account. The
Spanish King himself felt it necessary to dispel certain "scruples of
conscience" Henry might entertain as to the "sin" of marrying his
brother's
widow.<a id="footnotetag492" name="footnotetag492"></a><a href="#footnote492">[492]</a>
Warham and Fox debated the matter, and Warham
apparently opposed the
marriage.<a id="footnotetag493" name="footnotetag493"></a><a href="#footnote493">[493]</a>
A general council had pronounced
against the Pope's dispensing
power;<a id="footnotetag494" name="footnotetag494"></a><a href="#footnote494">[494]</a>
and, though the Popes had,
in effect, established their superiority over general councils, those
who still maintained the contrary view can hardly have failed to doubt
the legality of Henry's marriage.</p>

<p>So good a papalist as the young King, however, would hardly allow
theoretical doubts of the general powers of the Pope to outweigh the
practical advantages of a marriage in his own particular case; and it
is safe to assume that his confidence in its validity would have
remained unshaken, but for extraneous circumstances of a definite and
urgent nature. On the 31st of January, 1510, seven months after his
marriage with Catherine, she gave birth to her first child; it was a
daughter, and was
still-born.<a id="footnotetag495" name="footnotetag495"></a><a href="#footnote495">[495]</a>
On
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175"></a>(p. 175)</span>
the 27th of May
following she told her father that the event was considered in England
to be of evil omen, but that Henry took it cheerfully, and she thanked
God for having given her such a husband. "The King," wrote Catherine's
confessor, "adores her, and her highness him." Less than eight months
later, on the 1st of January, 1511, she was delivered of her
first-born
son.<a id="footnotetag496" name="footnotetag496"></a><a href="#footnote496">[496]</a>
A tourney was held to celebrate the joyous event,
and the heralds received a handsome largess at the christening. The
child was named Henry, styled Prince of Wales, and given a
serjeant-at-arms on the 14th, and a clerk of the signet on the 19th of
February. Three days later he was dead; he was buried at the cost of
some ten thousand pounds in Westminster Abbey. The rejoicings were
turned to grief, which, aggravated by successive disappointments, bore
with cumulative force on the mind of the King and his people. In
September, 1513, the Venetian ambassador announced the birth of
another
son,<a id="footnotetag497" name="footnotetag497"></a><a href="#footnote497">[497]</a>
who was either still-born, or died immediately
afterwards. In June, 1514, there is again a reference to the
christening of the "King's new
son,"<a id="footnotetag498" name="footnotetag498"></a><a href="#footnote498">[498]</a>
but he, too, was no sooner
christened than dead.</p>

<p>Domestic griefs were now embittered by political resentments.
Ferdinand valued his daughter mainly as a political emissary; he had
formally accredited her as his ambassador at Henry's Court, and she
naturally used her influence to maintain the political union between
her father and her husband. The arrangement had serious drawbacks;
when relations between sovereigns grew strained,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>(p. 176)</span>
their
ambassadors could be recalled, but Catherine had to stay. In 1514
Henry was boiling over with indignation at his double betrayal by the
Catholic king; and it is not surprising that he vented some of his
rage on the wife who was Ferdinand's representative. He reproached
her, writes Peter Martyr from Ferdinand's Court, with her father's
ill-faith, and taunted her with his own conquests. To this brutality
Martyr attributes the premature birth of Catherine's fourth son
towards the end of
1514.<a id="footnotetag499" name="footnotetag499"></a><a href="#footnote499">[499]</a>
Henry, in fact, was preparing to cast
off, not merely the Spanish alliance, but his Spanish wife. He was
negotiating for a joint attack on Castile with Louis XII. and
threatening the divorce of
Catherine.<a id="footnotetag500" name="footnotetag500"></a><a href="#footnote500">[500]</a>
"It is said," writes a
Venetian from Rome in August, 1514, "that the King of England means to
repudiate his present wife, the daughter of the King of Spain and his
brother's widow, because he is unable to have children by her, and
intends to marry a daughter of the French Duke of Bourbon.... He
intends to annul his own marriage, and will obtain what he wants from
the Pope as France did from Pope Julius
II."<a id="footnotetag501" name="footnotetag501"></a><a href="#footnote501">[501]</a></p>

<p>But the death of Louis XII. (January, 1515) and the consequent
loosening of the Anglo-French alliance made Henry and Ferdinand again
political allies; while, as the year wore on, Catherine was known to
be once more pregnant, and Henry's hopes of issue revived. This time
they were not disappointed; the Princess Mary was born on the 18th of
February,
1516.<a id="footnotetag502" name="footnotetag502"></a><a href="#footnote502">[502]</a>
Ferdinand had died on the 23rd of January, but
the news was kept from Catherine,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>(p. 177)</span>
lest it might add to the
risks of her
confinement.<a id="footnotetag503" name="footnotetag503"></a><a href="#footnote503">[503]</a>
The young princess seemed likely to
live, and Henry was delighted. When Giustinian, amid his
congratulations, said he would have been better pleased had it been a
son, the King replied: "We are both young; if it was a daughter this
time, by the grace of God the sons will
follow".<a id="footnotetag504" name="footnotetag504"></a><a href="#footnote504">[504]</a>
All thoughts of
a divorce passed away for the time, but the desired sons did not
arrive. In August, 1517, Catherine was reported to be again expecting
issue, but nothing more is heard of the matter, and it is probable
that about this time the Queen had various miscarriages. In July,
1518, Henry wrote to Wolsey from Woodstock that Catherine was once
more pregnant, and that he could not move the Court to London, as it
was one of the Queen's "dangerous
times".<a id="footnotetag505" name="footnotetag505"></a><a href="#footnote505">[505]</a>
His precautions were
unavailing, and, on the 10th of November, his child arrived
still-born. Giustinian notes the great vexation with which the people
heard the news, and expresses the opinion that, had it occurred a
month or two earlier, the Princess Mary would not have been betrothed
to the French dauphin, "as the one fear of England was lest it should
pass into subjection to France through that
marriage".<a id="footnotetag506" name="footnotetag506"></a><a href="#footnote506">[506]</a></p>

<p>The child was the last born of Catherine. For some years Henry went on
hoping against every probability that he might still have male issue
by his Queen; and in 1519 he undertook to lead a crusade against the
Turk in person if he should have an
heir.<a id="footnotetag507" name="footnotetag507"></a><a href="#footnote507">[507]</a>
But physicians summoned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>(p. 178)</span>
from Spain were no more successful than their
English colleagues. By 1525 the last ray of hope had flickered out.
Catherine was then forty years old; and Henry at the age of
thirty-four, in the full vigour of youthful manhood, seemed doomed by
the irony of fate and by his union with Catherine to leave a disputed
inheritance. Never did England's interests more imperatively demand a
secure and peaceful succession. Never before had there been such
mortality among the children of an English king; never before had an
English king married his brother's widow. So striking a coincidence
could be only explained by the relation of cause and effect. Men who
saw the judgment of God in the sack of Rome, might surely discern in
the fatality that attended the children of Henry VIII. a fulfilment of
the doom of childlessness pronounced in the Book of the Law against
him who should marry his brother's wife. "God," wrote the French
ambassador in 1528, "has long ago Himself passed sentence on
it;"<a id="footnotetag508" name="footnotetag508"></a><a href="#footnote508">[508]</a>
and there is no reason to doubt Henry's assertion, that he had come to
regard the death of his children as a Divine judgment, and that he was
impelled to question his marriage by the dictates of conscience. The
"scruples of conscience," which Henry VII. had urged as an excuse for
delaying the marriage, were merely a cloak for political reasons; but
scruples of conscience are dangerous playthings, and the pretence of
Henry VII. became, through the death of his children, a terrible
reality to Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Queen Catherine, too, had scruples of conscience about the marriage,
though of a different sort. When she first heard of Henry's intention
to seek a divorce, she is reported to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>(p. 179)</span>
have said that "she
had not offended, but it was a judgment of God, for that her former
marriage was made in blood"; the price of it had been the head of the
innocent Earl of Warwick, demanded by Ferdinand of
Aragon.<a id="footnotetag509" name="footnotetag509"></a><a href="#footnote509">[509]</a> Nor
was she alone in this feeling. "He had heard," witnessed Buckingham's
chancellor in 1521, "the Duke grudge that the Earl of Warwick was put
to death, and say that God would punish it, by not suffering the
King's issue to prosper, as appeared by the death of his sons; and
that his daughters prosper not, and that he had no issue
male."<a id="footnotetag510" name="footnotetag510"></a><a href="#footnote510">[510]</a></p>

<p>Conscience, however, often moves men in directions indicated by other
than conscientious motives, and, of the other motives which influenced
Henry's mind, some were respectable and some the reverse. The most
legitimate was his desire to provide for the succession to the throne.
It was obvious to him and his council that, if he died with no
children but Mary, England ran the risk of being plunged into an
anarchy worse than that of the civil wars. "By English law," wrote
Falier, the Venetian ambassador, in 1531, "females are excluded from
the throne;"<a id="footnotetag511" name="footnotetag511"></a><a href="#footnote511">[511]</a>
that was not true, but it was undoubtedly a
widespread impression, based upon the past history of England. No
Queen-Regnant had asserted a right to the English throne but one, and
that one precedent provided the most effective argument for avoiding a
repetition of the experiment. Matilda was never crowned, though she
had the same claim to the throne as Mary, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>(p. 180)</span>
her attempt to
enforce her title involved England in nineteen years of anarchy and
civil war. Stephen stood to Matilda in precisely the same relation as
James V. of Scotland stood to the Princess Mary; and in 1532, as soon
as he came of age, James was urged to style himself "Prince of
England" and Duke of York, in manifest derogation of Mary's
title.<a id="footnotetag512" name="footnotetag512"></a><a href="#footnote512">[512]</a>
At that time Charles V. was discussing alternative plans
for deposing Henry VIII. One was to set up James V., the other to
marry Mary to some great English noble and proclaim them King and
Queen;<a id="footnotetag513" name="footnotetag513"></a><a href="#footnote513">[513]</a>
Mary by herself was thought to have no chance of success.
John of Gaunt had maintained in Parliament that the succession
descended only through
males;<a id="footnotetag514" name="footnotetag514"></a><a href="#footnote514">[514]</a>
the Lancastrian case was that Henry
IV., the son of Edward III.'s fourth son, had a better title to the
throne than Philippa, the daughter of the third; an Act limiting the
succession to the male line was passed in
1406;<a id="footnotetag515" name="footnotetag515"></a><a href="#footnote515">[515]</a>
and Henry VII.
himself only reigned through a tacit denial of the right of women to
sit on the English throne.</p>

<p>The objection to female sovereigns was grounded not so much on male
disbelief in their personal qualifications, as upon the inevitable
consequence of matrimonial and dynastic
problems.<a id="footnotetag516" name="footnotetag516"></a><a href="#footnote516">[516]</a>
If the Princess Mary succeeded, was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>(p. 181)</span>
she to marry? If not, her death would
leave the kingdom no better provided with heirs than before; and in
her weak state of health, her death seemed no distant prospect. If, on
the other hand, she married, her husband must be either a subject or a
foreign prince. To marry a subject would at once create discords like
those from which the Wars of the Roses had sprung; to marry a foreign
prince was to threaten Englishmen, then more jealous than ever of
foreign influence, with the fear of alien domination. They had before
their eyes numerous instances in which matrimonial alliances had
involved the union of states so heterogeneous as Spain and the
Netherlands; and they had no mind to see England absorbed in some
continental empire. In the matrimonial schemes arranged for the
princess, it was generally stipulated that she should, in default of
male heirs, succeed to the throne of England; her succession was
obviously a matter of doubt, and it is quite certain that her marriage
in France or in Spain would have proved a bar in the way of her
succession to the English throne, or at least have given rise to
conflicting claims.</p>

<p>These rival pretensions began to be heard as soon as it became evident
that Henry VIII. would have no male heirs by Catherine of Aragon. In
1519, a year after the birth of the Queen's last child, Giustinian
reported to the Venetian signiory on the various nobles who had hopes
of the crown. The Duke of Norfolk had expectations in right of his
wife, a daughter of Edward IV., and the Duke of Suffolk in right of
his Duchess, the sister of Henry VIII. But the Duke of Buckingham was
the most formidable: "It was thought that, were the King to die
without male heirs, that Duke might easily obtain the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>(p. 182)</span>
crown".<a id="footnotetag517" name="footnotetag517"></a><a href="#footnote517">[517]</a>
His claims had been canvassed in 1503, when the issue of
Henry VII. seemed likely to
fail,<a id="footnotetag518" name="footnotetag518"></a><a href="#footnote518">[518]</a>
and now that the issue of Henry
VIII. was in even worse plight, Buckingham's claims to the crown
became again a matter of comment. His hopes of the crown cost him his
head; he had always been discontented with Tudor rule, especially
under Wolsey; he allowed himself to be encouraged with hopes of
succeeding the King, and possibly spoke of asserting his claim in case
of Henry's death. This was to touch Henry on his tenderest spot, and,
in 1521, the Duke was tried by his peers, found guilty of high
treason, and sent to the
block.<a id="footnotetag519" name="footnotetag519"></a><a href="#footnote519">[519]</a>
In this, as in all the great
trials of Henry's reign, and indeed in most state trials of all ages,
considerations of justice were subordinated to the real or supposed
dictates of political expediency. Buckingham was executed, not because
he was a criminal, but because he was, or might become, dangerous; his
crime was not treason, but descent from Edward III. Henry VIII., like
Henry VII., showed his grasp of the truth that nothing makes a
government so secure as the absence of all alternatives.</p>

<p>Buckingham's execution is one of the symptoms that, as early as 1521,
the failure of his issue had made Henry nervous and susceptible about
the succession. Even in 1519,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>(p. 183)</span>
when Charles V.'s minister,
Chièvres, was proposing to marry his niece to the Earl of Devonshire,
a grandson of Edward IV., Henry was suspicious, and Wolsey inquired
whether Chièvres was "looking to any chance of the Earl's succession
to the throne of
England."<a id="footnotetag520" name="footnotetag520"></a><a href="#footnote520">[520]</a>
If further proof were needed that
Henry's anxiety about the succession was not, as has been represented,
a mere afterthought intended to justify his divorce from Catherine, it
might be found in the extraordinary measures taken with regard to his
one and only illegitimate son. The boy was born in 1519. His mother
was Elizabeth Blount, sister of Erasmus's friend, Lord Mountjoy; and
she is noticed as taking part in the Court revels during the early
years of Henry's
reign.<a id="footnotetag521" name="footnotetag521"></a><a href="#footnote521">[521]</a>
Outwardly, at any rate, Henry's Court was
long a model of decorum; there was no parade of vice as in the days of
Charles II., and the existence of this royal bastard was so
effectually concealed that no reference to him occurs in the
correspondence of the time until 1525, when it was thought expedient
to give him a position of public importance. The necessity of
providing some male successor to Henry was considered so urgent that,
two years before the divorce is said to have occurred to him, he and
his council were meditating a scheme for entailing the succession on
the King's illegitimate son. In 1525 the child was created Duke of
Richmond and Somerset. These titles were significant; Earl of Richmond
had been Henry VII.'s title before he came to the throne; Duke of
Somerset had been that of his grandfather and of his youngest son.
Shortly afterwards the boy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>(p. 184)</span>
was made Lord High Admiral of
England, Lord Warden of the Marches, and Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland,<a id="footnotetag522" name="footnotetag522"></a><a href="#footnote522">[522]</a>
the two latter being offices which Henry VIII. himself
had held in his early youth. In January, 1527, the Spanish ambassador
reported that there was a scheme on foot to make the Duke King of
Ireland;<a id="footnotetag523" name="footnotetag523"></a><a href="#footnote523">[523]</a>
it was obviously a design to prepare the way for his
succession to the kingdom of England. The English envoys in Spain were
directed to tell the Emperor that Henry proposed to demand some noble
princess of near blood to the Emperor as a wife for the Duke of
Richmond. The Duke, they were to say, "is near of the King's blood and
of excellent qualities, and is already furnished to keep the state of
a great prince, and yet may be easily, by the King's means, exalted to
higher
things".<a id="footnotetag524" name="footnotetag524"></a><a href="#footnote524">[524]</a>
The lady suggested was Charles's niece, a
daughter of the Queen of Portugal; she was already promised to the
Dauphin of France, but the envoys remarked that, if that match were
broken off, she might find "another dauphin" in the Duke of Richmond.
Another plan for settling the succession was that the Duke should, by
papal dispensation, marry his half-sister Mary! Cardinal Campeggio saw
no moral objection to this. "At first I myself," he writes on his
arrival in England in October, 1528, "had thought of this as a means
of establishing the succession, but I do not believe that this design
would suffice to satisfy the King's
desires."<a id="footnotetag525" name="footnotetag525"></a><a href="#footnote525">[525]</a>
The Pope was
equally willing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>(p. 185)</span>
to facilitate the scheme, on condition that
Henry abandoned his divorce from
Catherine.<a id="footnotetag526" name="footnotetag526"></a><a href="#footnote526">[526]</a>
Possibly Henry saw
more objections than Pope or Cardinal to a marriage between brother
and sister. At all events Mary was soon betrothed to the French
prince, and the Emperor recorded his impression that the French
marriage was designed to remove the Princess from the Duke of
Richmond's path to the
throne.<a id="footnotetag527" name="footnotetag527"></a><a href="#footnote527">[527]</a></p>

<p>The conception of this violent expedient is mainly of interest as
illustrating the supreme importance attached to the question of
providing for a male successor to Henry. He wanted an heir to the
throne, and he wanted a fresh wife for that reason. A mistress would
not satisfy him, because his children by a mistress would hardly
succeed without dispute to the throne, not because he laboured under
any moral scruples on the point. He had already had two mistresses,
Elizabeth Blount, the mother of the Duke of Richmond, and Anne's
sister, Mary Boleyn. Possibly, even probably, there were other lapses
from conjugal fidelity, for, in 1533, the Duke of Norfolk told Chapuys
that Henry was always inclined to
amours;<a id="footnotetag528" name="footnotetag528"></a><a href="#footnote528">[528]</a>
but none are capable of
definite proof, and if Henry had other illegitimate children besides
the Duke of Richmond it is difficult to understand why their existence
should have been so effectually concealed when such publicity was
given their brother. The King is said to have had ten mistresses in
1528, but the statement is based on a misrepresentation of the only
document adduced in its
support.<a id="footnotetag529" name="footnotetag529"></a><a href="#footnote529">[529]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>(p. 186)</span>
It is a list of New
Year's
presents,<a id="footnotetag530" name="footnotetag530"></a><a href="#footnote530">[530]</a>
which runs "To thirty-three noble ladies" such
and such gifts, then "to ten mistresses" other gifts; it is doubtful
if the word then bore its modern sinister signification; in this
particular instance it merely means "gentlewomen," and differentiates
them from the noble ladies. Henry's morals, indeed, compare not
unfavourably with those of other sovereigns. His standard was neither
higher nor lower than that of Charles V., who was at this time
negotiating a marriage between his natural daughter and the Pope's
nephew; it was not lower than those of James II., of William III., or
of the first two Georges; it was infinitely higher than the standard
of Francis I., of Charles II., or even of Henry of Navarre and Louis
XIV.</p>

<p>The gross immorality so freely imputed to Henry seems to have as
little foundation as the theory that his sole object in seeking the
divorce from Catherine and separation from Rome was the gratification
of his passion for Anne Boleyn. If that had been the case, there would
be no adequate explanation of the persistence with which he pursued
the divorce. He was "studying the matter so diligently," Campeggio
says, "that I believe in this case he knows more than a great
theologian and jurist"; he was so convinced of the justice of his
cause "that an angel descending from heaven would be unable to
persuade him
otherwise".<a id="footnotetag531" name="footnotetag531"></a><a href="#footnote531">[531]</a>
He sent embassy after embassy to Rome;
he risked the enmity of Catholic Europe; he defied the authority of
the vicar of Christ; and lavished vast sums to obtain verdicts in his
favour from most of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>(p. 187)</span>
universities in Christendom. It is
not credible that all this energy was expended merely to satisfy a
sensual passion, which could be satisfied without a murmur from Pope
or Emperor, if he was content with Anne Boleyn as a mistress, and is
believed to have been already satisfied in 1529, four years before the
divorce was
obtained.<a id="footnotetag532" name="footnotetag532"></a><a href="#footnote532">[532]</a>
So, too, the actual sentence of divorce in
1533 was precipitated not by Henry's passion for Anne, but by the
desire that her child should be legitimate. She was pregnant before
Henry was married to her or divorced from Catherine. But, though the
representation of Henry's passion for Anne Boleyn as the sole <i>fons et
origo</i> of the divorce is far from convincing, that passion introduced
various complications into the question; it was not merely an
additional incentive to Henry's desires; it also brought Wolsey and
Henry into conflict; and the unpopularity of the divorce was increased
by the feeling that Henry was losing caste by seeking to marry a lady
of the rank and character of Anne Boleyn.</p>

<p class="p2"></p>

<p>The Boleyns were wealthy merchants of London, of which one of them had
been Lord-Mayor, but Anne's mother was of noble blood, being daughter
and co-heir of the Earl of
Ormonde,<a id="footnotetag533" name="footnotetag533"></a><a href="#footnote533">[533]</a>
and it is a curious fact that
all of Henry's wives could trace their descent from
Edward I.<a id="footnotetag534" name="footnotetag534"></a><a href="#footnote534">[534]</a>
Anne's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>(p. 188)</span>
age is uncertain, but she is generally believed to
have been born in
1507.<a id="footnotetag535" name="footnotetag535"></a><a href="#footnote535">[535]</a>
Attempts have been made to date her
influence over the King by the royal favours bestowed on her father,
Sir Thomas, afterwards Viscount Rochford and Earl of Wiltshire, but,
as these favours flowed in a fairly regular stream from the beginning
of the reign, as Sir Thomas's services were at least a colourable
excuse for them, and as his other daughter Mary was Henry's mistress
before he fell in love with Anne, these grants are not a very
substantial ground upon which to build. Of Anne herself little is
known except that, about 1519, she was sent as maid of honour to the
French Queen, Claude; five years before, her sister Mary had
accompanied Mary Tudor in a similar capacity on her marriage with
Louis XII.<a id="footnotetag536" name="footnotetag536"></a><a href="#footnote536">[536]</a>
In 1522, when war with France was on the eve of
breaking out, Anne was recalled to the English
Court,<a id="footnotetag537" name="footnotetag537"></a><a href="#footnote537">[537]</a>
where she
took part in revels and love-intrigues. Sir Thomas Wyatt, the poet,
although a married man, sued for her
favours;<a id="footnotetag538" name="footnotetag538"></a><a href="#footnote538">[538]</a>
Henry, Lord Percy
made her more honest proposals, but was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>(p. 189)</span>
compelled to desist
by the King himself, who had arranged for her marriage with Piers
Butler, son of the Earl of Ormond, as a means to end the feud between
the Butler and the Boleyn families.</p>

<p>None of these projects advanced any farther, possibly because they
conflicted with the relations developing between Anne and the King
himself. As Wyatt complained in a
sonnet,<a id="footnotetag539" name="footnotetag539"></a><a href="#footnote539">[539]</a></p>

<p class="poem">
There is written her fair neck round about<br>
<i>Noli me tangere</i>; for Cæsar's I am<br>
And wild for to hold, though I seem tame.
</p>

<p>But, for any definite documentary evidence to the contrary, it might
be urged that Henry's passion for Anne was subsequent to the
commencement of his proceedings for a divorce from Catherine. Those
proceedings began at least as early as March, 1527, while the first
allusion to the connection between the King and Anne Boleyn occurs in
the instructions to Dr. William Knight, sent in the following autumn
to procure a dispensation for her marriage with
Henry.<a id="footnotetag540" name="footnotetag540"></a><a href="#footnote540">[540]</a>
The King's
famous love-letters, the earliest of which are conjecturally assigned
to July,
1527,<a id="footnotetag541" name="footnotetag541"></a><a href="#footnote541">[541]</a>
are without date and with but slight internal
indications of the time at which they were written; they may be
earlier than 1527, they may be as late as the following winter. It is
unlikely that Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>(p. 190)</span>
would have sought for the Pope's
dispensation to marry Anne until he was assured of her consent, of
which in some of the letters he appears to be doubtful; on the other
hand, it is difficult to see how a lady of the Court could refuse an
offer of marriage made by her sovereign. Her reluctance was to fill a
less honourable position, into which Henry was not so wicked as to
think of forcing her. "I trust," he writes in one of his letters,
"your absence is not wilful on your part; for if so, I can but lament
my ill-fortune, and by degrees abate my great
folly."<a id="footnotetag542" name="footnotetag542"></a><a href="#footnote542">[542]</a>
His love
for Anne Boleyn was certainly his "great folly," the one overmastering
passion of his life. There is, however, nothing very extraordinary in
the letters themselves; in one he says he has for more than a year
been "wounded with the dart of love," and is uncertain whether Anne
returns his affection. In others he bewails her briefest absence as
though it were an eternity; desires her father to hasten his return to
Court; is torn with anxiety lest Anne should take the plague, comforts
her with the assurance that few women have had it, and sends her a
hart killed by his own hand, making the inevitable play on the word.
Later on, he alludes to the progress of the divorce case; excuses the
shortness of a letter on the ground that he has spent four hours over
the book he was writing in his own
defence<a id="footnotetag543" name="footnotetag543"></a><a href="#footnote543">[543]</a>
and has a pain in his
head. The series ends with an announcement that he has been fitting up
apartments for her, and with congratulations to himself and to her
that the "well-wishing" Legate, Campeggio, who has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>(p. 191)</span>
been sent
from Rome to try the case, has told him he was not so "imperial" in
his sympathies as had been alleged.</p>

<p>The secret of her fascination over Henry was a puzzle to observers.
"Madame Anne," wrote a Venetian, "is not one of the handsomest women
in the world. She is of middling stature, swarthy complexion, long
neck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised, and in fact has nothing but
the King's great appetite, and her eyes, which are black and
beautiful".<a id="footnotetag544" name="footnotetag544"></a><a href="#footnote544">[544]</a>
She had probably learnt in France the art of using
her beautiful eyes to the best advantage; her hair, which was long and
black, she wore loose, and on her way to her coronation Cranmer
describes her as "sitting <i>in</i> her
hair".<a id="footnotetag545" name="footnotetag545"></a><a href="#footnote545">[545]</a>
Possibly this was one
of the French customs, which somewhat scandalised the staider ladies
of the English Court. She is said to have had a slight defect on one
of her nails, which she endeavoured to conceal behind her other
fingers.<a id="footnotetag546" name="footnotetag546"></a><a href="#footnote546">[546]</a>
Of her mental accomplishments there is not much
evidence; she naturally, after some years' residence at the Court of
France, spoke French, though she wrote it in an orthography that was
quite her own. Her devotion to the Gospel is the one great virtue with
which Foxe and other Elizabethans strove to invest the mother of the
Good Queen Bess. But it had no nobler foundation than the facts that
Anne's position drove her into hostility to the Roman jurisdiction,
and that her family shared the envy of church goods, common to the
nobility and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>(p. 192)</span>
the gentry of the
time.<a id="footnotetag547" name="footnotetag547"></a><a href="#footnote547">[547]</a>
Her place in
English history is due solely to the circumstance that she appealed to
the less refined part of Henry's nature; she was pre-eminent neither
in beauty nor in intellect, and her virtue was not of a character to
command or deserve the respect of her own or subsequent ages.</p>

<p>It is otherwise with her rival, Queen Catherine, the third of the
principal characters involved in the divorce. If Henry's motives were
not so entirely bad as they have often been represented, neither they
nor Anne Boleyn's can stand a moment's comparison with the unsullied
purity of Catherine's life or the lofty courage with which she
defended the cause she believed to be right. There is no more pathetic
figure in English history, nor one condemned to a crueller fate. No
breath of scandal touched her fair name, or impugned her devotion to
Henry. If she had the misfortune to be identified with a particular
policy, the alliance with the House of Burgundy, the fault was not
hers; she had been married to Henry in consideration of the advantages
which that alliance was supposed to confer; and, if she used her
influence to further Spanish interest, it was a natural feeling as
near akin to virtue as to vice, and Carroz at least complained, in
1514, that she had completely identified herself with her husband and
her husband's
subjects.<a id="footnotetag548" name="footnotetag548"></a><a href="#footnote548">[548]</a> If
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>(p. 193)</span>
her miscarriages and the
death of her children were a grief to Henry, the pain and the sorrow
were hers in far greater measure; if they had made her old and
deformed, as Francis brutally described her in
1519,<a id="footnotetag549" name="footnotetag549"></a><a href="#footnote549">[549]</a>
the fact
must have been far more bitter to her than it was unpleasant to Henry.
There may have been some hardship to Henry in the circumstance that,
for political motives, he had been induced by his council to marry a
wife who was six years his senior; but to Catherine herself a divorce
was the height of injustice. The question was in fact one of justice
against a real or supposed political necessity, and in such cases
justice commonly goes to the wall. In politics, men seek to colour
with justice actions based upon considerations of expediency. They
first convince themselves, and then they endeavour with less success
to persuade mankind.</p>

<p>So Henry VIII. convinced himself that the dispensation granted by
Julius II. was null and void, that he had never been married to
Catherine, and that to continue to live with his brother's wife was
sin. "The King," he instructed his ambassador to tell Charles V. in
1533, "taketh himself to be in the right, not because so many say it,
but because he, being learned, knoweth the matter to be right.... The
justice of our cause is so rooted in our breast that nothing can
remove it, and even the canons say that a man should rather endure all
the censures of the Church than offend his
conscience."<a id="footnotetag550" name="footnotetag550"></a><a href="#footnote550">[550]</a>
No man
was less tolerant of heresy than Henry, but no man set
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>(p. 194)</span>
greater store on his own private judgment. To that extent he was a
Protestant; "though," he instructed Paget in 1534 to tell the Lutheran
princes, "the law of every man's conscience be but a private court,
yet it is the highest and supreme court for judgment or justice". God
and his conscience, he told Chapuys in 1533, were on very good
terms.<a id="footnotetag551" name="footnotetag551"></a><a href="#footnote551">[551]</a>
On another occasion he wrote to Charles <i>Ubi Spiritus
Domini, ibi
libertas</i>,<a id="footnotetag552" name="footnotetag552"></a><a href="#footnote552">[552]</a>
with the obvious implication that he
possessed the spirit of the Lord, and therefore he might do as he
liked. To him, as to St. Paul, all things were lawful; and Henry's
appeals to the Pope, to learned divines, to universities at home and
abroad, were not for his own satisfaction, but were merely concessions
to the profane herd, unskilled in royal learning and unblessed with a
kingly conscience. Against that conviction, so firmly rooted in the
royal breast, appeals to pity were vain, and attempts to shake it were
perilous. It was his conscience that made Henry so dangerous. Men are
tolerant of differences about things indifferent, but conscience makes
bigots of us all; theological hatreds are proverbially bitter, and
religious wars are cruel. Conscience made Sir Thomas More persecute,
and glory in the persecution of
heretics,<a id="footnotetag553" name="footnotetag553"></a><a href="#footnote553">[553]</a>
and conscience earned
Mary her epithet "Bloody". They were moved by conscientious belief in
the Catholic faith, Henry by conscientious belief in himself; and
conscientious scruples are none the less exigent for being reached by
crooked paths.</p>




<h3>CHAPTER VIII.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>(p. 195)</span></h3>

<h4>THE POPE'S DILEMMA.</h4>


<p>In February, 1527, in pursuance of the alliance with France, which
Wolsey, recognising too late the fatal effects of the union with
Charles, was seeking to make the basis of English policy, a French
embassy arrived in England to conclude a marriage between Francis I.
and the Princess Mary. At its head was Gabriel de Grammont, Bishop of
Tarbes; and in the course of his negotiations he is alleged to have
first suggested those doubts of the validity of Henry's marriage,
which ended in the divorce. The allegation was made by Wolsey three
months later, and from that time down to our own day it has done duty
with Henry's apologists as a sufficient vindication of his conduct. It
is now denounced as an impudent fiction, mainly on the ground that no
hint of these doubts occurs in the extant records of the negotiations.
But unfortunately we have only one or two letters relating to this
diplomatic
mission.<a id="footnotetag554" name="footnotetag554"></a><a href="#footnote554">[554]</a>
There exists,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>(p. 196)</span>
indeed, a detailed
narrative, drawn up some time afterwards by Claude Dodieu, the French
secretary; but the silence, on so confidential a matter, of a third
party who was not present when the doubts were presumably suggested,
proves little or nothing. Du Bellay, in 1528, reported to the French
Government Henry's public assertion that Tarbes had mentioned these
doubts;<a id="footnotetag555" name="footnotetag555"></a><a href="#footnote555">[555]</a>
the statement was not repudiated; Tarbes himself believed
in the validity of Henry's case and was frequently employed in efforts
to win from the Pope an assent to Henry's divorce. It is rather a
strong assumption to suppose in the entire absence of positive
evidence that Henry and Wolsey were deliberately lying. There is
nothing impossible in the supposition that some such doubts were
expressed; indeed, Francis I. had every reason to encourage doubts of
Henry's marriage as a means of creating a breach between him and
Charles V. In return for Mary's hand, Henry was endeavouring to obtain
various advantages from Francis in the way of pensions, tribute and
territory. Tarbes represented that the French King was so good a match
for the English princess, that there was little need for further
concession; to which Henry replied that Francis was no doubt an
excellent match for his daughter, but was he free to marry? His
precontract with Charles V.'s sister, Eleanor, was a complication
which seriously diminished the value of Francis's offer; and the papal
dispensation, which he hoped
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>(p. 197)</span>
to obtain, might not be
forthcoming or
valid.<a id="footnotetag556" name="footnotetag556"></a><a href="#footnote556">[556]</a>
As a counter to this stroke, Tarbes may
well have hinted that the Princess Mary was not such a prize as Henry
made out. Was the dispensation for Henry's own marriage beyond cavil?
Was Mary's legitimacy beyond question? Was her succession to the
English throne, a prospect Henry dangled before the Frenchman's eyes,
so secure? These questions were not very new, even at the time of
Tarbes's mission. The divorce had been talked about in 1514, and now,
in 1527, the position of importance given to the Duke of Richmond was
a matter of public comment, and inevitably suggested doubts of Mary's
succession. There is no documentary evidence that this argument was
ever employed, beyond the fact that, within three months of Tarbes's
mission, both Henry and Wolsey asserted that the Bishop had suggested
doubts of the validity of Henry's
marriage.<a id="footnotetag557" name="footnotetag557"></a><a href="#footnote557">[557]</a>
Henry, however, does
not say that Tarbes <i>first</i> suggested the doubts, nor does Wolsey. The
Cardinal declares that the Bishop objected to the marriage with the
Princess Mary on the ground of these doubts; and some time later, when
Henry explained his position to the Lord-Mayor and aldermen of London,
he said, according to Du Bellay, that the scruple of conscience, which
he had <i>long</i> entertained, had terribly increased upon him since
Tarbes had spoken of
it.<a id="footnotetag558" name="footnotetag558"></a><a href="#footnote558">[558]</a></p>

<p>However
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>(p. 198)</span>
that may be, before the Bishop's negotiations were
completed the first steps had been taken towards the divorce, or, as
Wolsey and Henry pretended, towards satisfying the King's scruples as
to the validity of his marriage. Early in April, 1527, Dr. Richard
Wolman was sent down to Winchester to examine old Bishop Fox on the
subject.<a id="footnotetag559" name="footnotetag559"></a><a href="#footnote559">[559]</a>
The greatest secrecy was observed and none of the
Bishop's councillors were allowed to be present. Other evidence was
doubtless collected from various sources, and, on 17th May, a week
after Tarbes's departure, Wolsey summoned Henry to appear before him
to explain his conduct in living with his brother's
widow.<a id="footnotetag560" name="footnotetag560"></a><a href="#footnote560">[560]</a>
Wolman
was appointed promoter of the suit; Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>(p. 199)</span>
put in a
justification, and, on 31st May, Wolman replied. With that the
proceedings terminated. In instituting them Henry was following a
precedent set by his brother-in-law, the Duke of
Suffolk.<a id="footnotetag561" name="footnotetag561"></a><a href="#footnote561">[561]</a>
In very
early days that nobleman had contracted to marry Sir Anthony Browne's
daughter, but for some reason the match was broken off, and he sought
the hand of one Margaret Mortimer, to whom he was related in the
second and third degrees of consanguinity; he obtained a dispensation,
completed the marriage, and cohabited with Margaret Mortimer. But,
like Henry VIII., his conscience or other considerations moved him to
regard his marriage as sin, and the dispensation as invalid. He caused
a declaration to that effect to be made by "the official of the
Archdeacon of London, to whom the cognisance of such causes of old
belongs," married Ann Browne, and, after her death, Henry's sister
Mary. A marriage, the validity of which depended, like Henry's, upon a
papal dispensation, and which, like Henry's, had been consummated, was
declared null and void on exactly the same grounds as those upon which
Henry himself sought a divorce, namely, the invalidity of the previous
dispensation. On 12th May, 1528, Clement VII. issued a bull confirming
Suffolk's divorce and pronouncing ecclesiastical censures on all who
called in question the Duke's subsequent marriages. That is precisely
the course Henry wished to be followed. Wolsey was to declare the
marriage invalid on the ground of the insufficiency of the papal
dispensation; Henry might then marry whom he pleased; the Pope was to
confirm the sentence, and censure all who should dispute the second
marriage or the legitimacy of its possible issue.</p>

<p>Another
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>(p. 200)</span>
precedent was also forced on Henry's mind. On 11th
March, 1527, two months before Wolsey opened his court, a divorce was
granted at Rome to Henry's sister Margaret, Queen of
Scotland.<a id="footnotetag562" name="footnotetag562"></a><a href="#footnote562">[562]</a>
Her pretexts were infinitely more flimsy than Henry's own. She alleged
a precontract on the part of her husband, Angus, which was never
proved. She professed to believe that James IV. had survived Flodden
three years, and was alive when she married Angus. Angus had been
unfaithful, but that was no ground for divorce by canon law; and she
herself was living in shameless adultery with Henry Stewart, who had
also procured a divorce to be free to marry his Queen. No objection
was found at Rome to either of these divorces; but neither Angus nor
Margaret Mortimer had an Emperor for a nephew; no imperial armies
would march on Rome to vindicate the validity of their marriages, and
Clement could issue his bulls without any fear that their justice
would be challenged by the arms of powerful princes. Not so with
Henry; while the secret proceedings before Wolsey were in progress,
the world was shocked by the sack of Rome, and Clement was a prisoner
in the hands of the Emperor's troops. There was no hope that a Pope in
such a plight would confirm a sentence to the detriment of his
master's aunt. "If the Pope," wrote Wolsey to Henry on receipt of the
news, "be slain or taken, it will hinder the King's affairs not a
little, which have hitherto been going on so
well."<a id="footnotetag563" name="footnotetag563"></a><a href="#footnote563">[563]</a>
A little
later he declared that, if Catherine repudiated his authority, it
would be necessary to have the assent of the Pope or of the cardinals
to the divorce. To obtain the former the Pope must be liberated; to
secure
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>(p. 201)</span>
the latter the cardinals must be assembled in
France.<a id="footnotetag564" name="footnotetag564"></a><a href="#footnote564">[564]</a></p>

<p>To effect the Pope's liberation, or rather to call an assembly of
cardinals in France during Clement's captivity, was the real object of
the mission to France, on which Wolsey started in July. Such a body,
acting under Wolsey's presidency and in the territories of the French
King, was as likely to favour an attack upon the Emperor's aunt as the
Pope in the hands of Charles's armies was certain to oppose it. Wolsey
went in unparalleled splendour, not as Henry's ambassador but as his
lieutenant; and projects for his own advancement were, as usual, part
of the programme. Louise of Savoy, the queen-mother of France,
suggested to him that all Christian princes should repudiate the
Pope's authority so long as he remained in captivity, and the Cardinal
replied that, had the overture not been made by her, it would have
been started by himself and by
Henry.<a id="footnotetag565" name="footnotetag565"></a><a href="#footnote565">[565]</a>
It was rumoured in Spain
that Wolsey "had gone into France to separate the Church of England
and of France from the Roman, not merely during the captivity of the
Pope and to effect his liberation, but for a perpetual
division,"<a id="footnotetag566" name="footnotetag566"></a><a href="#footnote566">[566]</a>
and that Francis was offering Wolsey the patriarchate of the two
schismatic churches. To win over the Cardinal to the interest of
Spain, it was even suggested that Charles should depose Clement and
offer the Papacy to
Wolsey.<a id="footnotetag567" name="footnotetag567"></a><a href="#footnote567">[567]</a>
The project of a schism was not found
feasible; the cardinals at Rome were too numerous, and Wolsey only
succeeded in gaining four, three French and one Italian, to join him
in signing a protest repudiating Clement's authority
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>(p. 202)</span>
so long
as he remained in the Emperor's power. It was necessary to fall back
after all on the Pope for assent to Henry's divorce, and the news that
Charles had already got wind of the proceedings against Catherine made
it advisable that no time should be lost. The Emperor, indeed, had
long been aware of Henry's intentions; every care had been taken to
prevent communication between Catherine and her nephew, and a plot had
been laid to kidnap a messenger she was sending in August to convey
her appeal for protection. All was in vain, for the very day after
Wolsey's court had opened in May, Mendoza wrote to Charles that Wolsey
"as the finishing stroke to all his iniquities, had been scheming to
bring about the Queen's divorce"; and on the 29th of July, some days
before Wolsey had any suspicion that a hint was abroad, Charles
informed Mendoza that he had despatched Cardinal Quignon to Rome, to
act on the Queen's behalf and to persuade Clement to revoke Wolsey's
legatine
powers.<a id="footnotetag568" name="footnotetag568"></a><a href="#footnote568">[568]</a></p>

<p>In ignorance of all this, Wolsey urged Henry to send Ghinucci, the
Bishop of Worcester, and others to Rome with certain demands, among
which was a request for Clement's assent to the abortive proposal for
a council in
France.<a id="footnotetag569" name="footnotetag569"></a><a href="#footnote569">[569]</a>
But now a divergence became apparent between
the policy of Wolsey and that of his king. Both were working for a
divorce, but Wolsey wanted Henry to marry as his second wife Renée,
the daughter of Louis XII., and thus bind more closely the two kings,
upon whose union the Cardinal's personal and political schemes were
now exclusively based. Henry, however, had determined that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>(p. 203)</span>
his second wife was to be Anne Boleyn, and of this determination
Wolsey was as yet uninformed. The Cardinal had good reason to dread
that lady's ascendancy over Henry's mind; for she was the hope and the
tool of the anti-clerical party, which had hitherto been kept in check
by Wolsey's supremacy. The Duke of Norfolk was her uncle, and he was
hostile to Wolsey for both private and public reasons; her father,
Viscount Rochford, her cousins, Sir William Fitzwilliam and Sir
Francis Brian, and many more distant connections, were anxious at the
first opportunity to lead an attack on the Church and Cardinal. Before
the divorce case began Wolsey's position had grown precarious; taxes
at home and failure abroad had turned the loyalty of the people to
sullen discontent, and Wolsey was mainly responsible. "Disaffection to
the King," wrote Mendoza in March, 1527, "and hatred of the Legate are
visible everywhere.... The King would soon be obliged to change his
councillors, were only a leader to present himself and head the
malcontents;" and in May he reported a general rumour to the effect
that Henry intended to relieve the Legate of his share in the
administration.<a id="footnotetag570" name="footnotetag570"></a><a href="#footnote570">[570]</a>
The Cardinal had incurred the dislike of nearly
every section of the community; the King was his sole support and the
King was beginning to waver. In May there were high words between
Wolsey and Norfolk in Henry's
presence;<a id="footnotetag571" name="footnotetag571"></a><a href="#footnote571">[571]</a>
in July King and Cardinal
were quarrelling over ecclesiastical patronage at
Calais,<a id="footnotetag572" name="footnotetag572"></a><a href="#footnote572">[572]</a>
and,
long before the failure of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>(p. 204)</span>
divorce suit, there were
other indications that Henry and his minister had ceased to work
together in harmony.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, quite a mistake to represent Wolsey's failure to obtain
a sentence in Henry's favour as the sole or main cause of his fall.
Had he succeeded, he might have deferred for a time his otherwise
unavoidable ruin, but it was his last and only chance. He was driven
to playing a desperate game, in which the dice were loaded against
him. If his plan failed, he told Clement over and over again, it would
mean for him irretrievable ruin, and in his fall he would drag down
the Church. If it succeeded, he would be hardly more secure, for
success meant the predominance of Anne Boleyn and of her
anti-ecclesiastical kin. Under the circumstances, it is possible to
attach too much weight to the opinion of the French and Spanish
ambassadors, and of Charles V. himself, that Wolsey suggested the
divorce as the means of breaking for ever the alliance between England
and the House of Burgundy, and substituting for it a union with
France.<a id="footnotetag573" name="footnotetag573"></a><a href="#footnote573">[573]</a>
The divorce fitted in so well with Wolsey's French
policy, that the suspicion was natural; but the same observers also
recorded the impression that Wolsey was secretly opposing the divorce
from fear of the ascendancy of Anne
Boleyn.<a id="footnotetag574" name="footnotetag574"></a><a href="#footnote574">[574]</a>
That suspicion had
been brought to Henry's mind as early as June, 1527. It was probably
due to the facts that Wolsey was not blinded by passion, as Henry was,
to the difficulties in the way, and that it was he who persuaded Henry
to have recourse to the Pope in the first
instance,<a id="footnotetag575" name="footnotetag575"></a><a href="#footnote575">[575]</a>
when the King
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>(p. 205)</span>
desired to follow Suffolk's precedent, obtain a
sentence in England, marry again, and trust to the Pope to confirm his
proceedings.</p>

<p>It is not, however, impossible to trace Wolsey's real designs behind
these conflicting reports. He knew that Henry was determined to have a
divorce and that this was one of those occasions upon which "he would
be obeyed, whosoever spoke to the contrary". As minister he must
therefore either resign&mdash;a difficult thing in the sixteenth
century&mdash;or carry out the King's policy. For his own part he had no
objection to the divorce in itself; he was no more touched by the
pathos of Catherine's fate than was her nephew Charles V., he wished
to see the succession strengthened, he thought that he might restore
his tottering influence by obtaining gratification for the King, and
he was straining every nerve to weaken Charles V., either because the
Emperor's power was really too great, or out of revenge for his
betrayal over the papal election. But he was strenuously hostile to
Henry's marriage with Anne Boleyn for two excellent reasons: firstly
she and her kin belonged to the anti-ecclesiastical party which Wolsey
had dreaded since 1515, and secondly he desired Henry to marry the
French Princess Renée in order to strengthen his anti-imperial policy.
Further, he was anxious that the divorce problem should be solved by
means of the Papacy, because its solution by merely national action
would create a breach between England and Rome, would ruin Wolsey's
chances of election as Pope, would threaten his ecclesiastical
supremacy in England,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>(p. 206)</span>
which was merely a legatine authority
dependent on the
Pope,<a id="footnotetag576" name="footnotetag576"></a><a href="#footnote576">[576]</a>
and would throw Clement into the arms of
Charles V., whereas Wolsey desired him to be an effective member of
the anti-imperial alliance. Thus Wolsey was prepared to go part of the
way with Henry VIII., but he clearly saw the point at which their
paths would diverge; and his efforts on Henry's behalf were hampered
by his endeavours to keep the King on the track which he had marked
out.</p>

<p>Henry's suspicions, and his knowledge that Wolsey would be hostile to
his marriage with Anne Boleyn, induced him to act for the time
independently of the Cardinal; and, while Wolsey was in France hinting
at a marriage between Henry and Renée, the King himself was secretly
endeavouring to remove the obstacles to his union with Anne Boleyn.
Instead of adopting Wolsey's suggestion that Ghinucci should be sent
to Rome as an Italian versed in the ways of the Papal Curia, he
despatched his secretary, Dr. William Knight, with two extraordinary
commissions, the second of which he thought would not be revealed "for
any craft the Cardinal or any other can
find".<a id="footnotetag577" name="footnotetag577"></a><a href="#footnote577">[577]</a>
The first was to
obtain from the Pope a dispensation to marry a second wife, without
being divorced from Catherine, the issue from both marriages to be
legitimate. This "licence to commit bigamy" has naturally been the
subject of much righteous indignation.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span>
But marriage-laws
were lax in those days, when Popes could play fast and loose with them
for political purposes; and, besides the "great reasons and
precedents, especially in the Old Testament," to which Henry
referred,<a id="footnotetag578" name="footnotetag578"></a><a href="#footnote578">[578]</a>
he might have produced a precedent more pertinent, more
recent, and better calculated to appeal to Clement VII. In 1521
Charles V.'s Spanish council drew up a memorial on the subject of his
marriage, in which they pointed out that his ancestor, Henry IV. of
Castile, had, in 1437, married Dona Blanca, by whom he had no
children; and that the Pope thereupon granted him a dispensation to
marry a second wife on condition that, if within a fixed time he had
no issue by her, he should return to his
first.<a id="footnotetag579" name="footnotetag579"></a><a href="#footnote579">[579]</a>
A licence for
bigamy, modelled after this precedent, would have suited Henry
admirably, but apparently he was unaware of this useful example, and
was induced to countermand Knight's commission before it had been
communicated to Clement. The demand would not, however, have shocked
the Pope so much as his modern defenders, for on 18th September, 1530,
Casale writes to Henry: "A few days since the Pope secretly proposed
to me that your Majesty might be allowed two wives. I told him I could
not undertake to make any such proposition, because I did not know
whether it would satisfy your Majesty's conscience. I made this answer
because I know that the Imperialists have this in view, and are urging
it; but why, I know
not."<a id="footnotetag580" name="footnotetag580"></a><a href="#footnote580">[580]</a>
Ghinucci and Benet were equally
cautious, and thought the Pope's suggestion was only a ruse; whether
a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>(p. 208)</span>
ruse or not, it is a curious illustration of the moral
influence Popes were then likely to exert on their flock.</p>

<p>The second commission, with which Knight was entrusted, was hardly
less strange than the first. By his illicit relations with Mary
Boleyn, Henry had already contracted affinity in the first degree with
her sister Anne, in fact precisely the same affinity (except that it
was illicit) as that which Catherine was alleged to have contracted
with him before their marriage. The inconsistency of Henry's conduct,
in seeking to remove by the same method from his second marriage the
disability which was held to invalidate his first, helps us to define
the precise position which Henry took up and the nature of his
peculiar conscience. Obviously he did not at this stage deny the
Pope's dispensing power; for he was invoking its aid to enable him to
marry Anne Boleyn. He asserted, and he denied, no principle whatever,
though it must be remembered that his own dispensation was an almost,
if not quite, unprecedented stretch of papal power. To dispense with
the "divine" law against marrying the brother's wife, and to dispense
with the merely canonical obstacle to his marriage with Anne arising
out of his relations with Mary Boleyn, were very different matters;
and in this light the breach between England and Rome might be
represented as caused by a novel extension of papal claims. Henry,
however, was a casuist concerned exclusively with his own case. He
maintained merely that the particular dispensation, granted for his
marriage with Catherine, was null and void. As a concession to others,
he condescended to give a number of reasons, none of them affecting
any principle, but only the legal technicalities of the case&mdash;the
causes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>(p. 209)</span>
for which the dispensation was granted, such as his
own desire, and the political necessity for the marriage were
fictitious; he had himself protested against the marriage, and so
forth. For himself, his own conviction was ample sanction; he knew he
was living in sin with Catherine because his children had all died but
one, and that was a manifest token of the wrath of Providence. The
capacity for convincing himself of his own righteousness is the most
effective weapon in the egotist's armoury, and Henry's egotism touched
the sublime. His conscience was clear, whatever other people might
think of the maze of apparent inconsistencies in which he was
involved. In 1528 he was in some fear of death from the plague; fear
of death is fatal to the peace of a guilty conscience, and it might
well have made Henry pause in his pursuit after the divorce and Anne
Boleyn. But Henry never wavered; he went on in serene assurance,
writing his love letters to Anne, as a conscientiously unmarried man
might do, making his
will,<a id="footnotetag581" name="footnotetag581"></a><a href="#footnote581">[581]</a>
"confessing every day and receiving
his Maker at every
feast,"<a id="footnotetag582" name="footnotetag582"></a><a href="#footnote582">[582]</a>
paying great attention to the morals
of monasteries, and to charges of malversation against Wolsey, and
severely lecturing his sister Margaret on the sinfulness of her
life.<a id="footnotetag583" name="footnotetag583"></a><a href="#footnote583">[583]</a>
He hopes she will turn "to God's word, the vively doctrine
of Jesu Christ, the only ground of salvation&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Cor.</span> 3, etc."; he
reminds her of "the divine ordinance of inseparable matrimony first
instituted in Paradise," and urges her to avoid "the inevitable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>(p. 210)</span>
damnation threatened against advoutrers". Henry's conscience was
convenient and skilful. He believed in the "ordinance of inseparable
matrimony," so, when he wished to divorce a wife, his conscience
warned him that he had never really been married to her. Hence his
nullity suits with Catherine of Aragon, with Anne Boleyn and with Anne
of Cleves. Moreover, if he had never been married to Catherine, his
relations with Mary Boleyn and Elizabeth Blount were obviously not
adultery, and he was free to denounce that sin in Margaret with a
clear conscience.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>Dr. Knight had comparatively little difficulty in obtaining the
dispensation for Henry's marriage with Anne Boleyn; but it was only to
be effective after sentence had been given decreeing the nullity of
his marriage with Catherine of Aragon; and, as Wolsey saw, that was
the real crux of the
question.<a id="footnotetag584" name="footnotetag584"></a><a href="#footnote584">[584]</a>
Knight had scarcely turned his
steps homeward, when he was met by a courier with fresh instructions
from Wolsey to obtain a further concession from Clement; the Pope was
to empower the Cardinal himself, or some other safe person, to examine
the original dispensation, and, if it were found invalid, to annul
Henry's marriage with Catherine. So Knight returned to the Papal
Court; and then began that struggle between
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>(p. 211)</span>
English and
Spanish influence at Rome which ended in the victory of Charles V. and
the repudiation by England of the Roman jurisdiction. Never did two
parties enter upon a contest with a clearer perception of the issues
involved, or carry it on with their eyes more open to the magnitude of
the results. Wolsey himself, Gardiner, Foxe, Casale, and every English
envoy employed in the case, warned and threatened Clement that, if he
refused Henry's demands, he would involve Wolsey and the Papal cause
in England in a common ruin. "He alleged," says Campeggio of Wolsey,
"that if the King's desire were not complied with... there would
follow the speedy and total ruin of the kingdom, of his Lordship and
of the Church's influence in this
kingdom."<a id="footnotetag585" name="footnotetag585"></a><a href="#footnote585">[585]</a>
"I cannot reflect
upon it," wrote Wolsey himself, "and close my eyes, for I see ruin,
infamy and subversion of the whole dignity and estimation of the See
Apostolic if this course is persisted in. You see in what dangerous
times we are. If the Pope will consider the gravity of this cause, and
how much the safety of the nation depends upon it, he will see that
the course he now pursues will drive the King to adopt remedies which
are injurious to the Pope, and are frequently instilled into the
King's
mind."<a id="footnotetag586" name="footnotetag586"></a><a href="#footnote586">[586]</a>
On one occasion Clement confessed that, though the
Pope was supposed to carry the papal laws locked up in his breast,
Providence had not vouchsafed him the key wherewith to unlock them;
and Gardiner roughly asked in retort whether in that case the papal
laws should not be committed to the
flames.<a id="footnotetag587" name="footnotetag587"></a><a href="#footnote587">[587]</a>
He told how the
Lutherans were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>(p. 212)</span>
instigating Henry to do away with the
temporal possessions of the
Church.<a id="footnotetag588" name="footnotetag588"></a><a href="#footnote588">[588]</a>
But Clement could only bewail
his misfortune, and protest that, if heresies and schisms arose, it
was not his fault. He could not afford to offend the all-powerful
Emperor; the sack of Rome and Charles's intimation conveyed in plain
and set terms that it was the judgment of
God<a id="footnotetag589" name="footnotetag589"></a><a href="#footnote589">[589]</a>
had cowed Clement
for the rest of his life, and made him resolve never again to incur
the Emperor's enmity.</p>

<p>From the point of view of justice, the Pope had an excellent case;
even the Lutherans, who denied his dispensing power, denounced the
divorce. <i>Quod non fieri debuit</i>, was their just and common-sense
point, <i>factum valet</i>. But the Pope's case had been hopelessly
weakened by the evil practice of his predecessors and of himself.
Alexander VI. had divorced Louis XII. from his Queen for no other
reasons than that Louis XII. wanted to unite Brittany with France by
marrying its duchess, and that Alexander, the Borgia Pope, required
Louis' assistance in promoting the interests of the iniquitous Borgia
family.<a id="footnotetag590" name="footnotetag590"></a><a href="#footnote590">[590]</a>
The injustice to Catherine was no greater than that to
Louis' Queen. Henry's sister Margaret, and both the husbands of his
other sister, Mary, had procured divorces from Popes, and why not
Henry himself? Clement was ready enough to grant Margaret's
divorce;<a id="footnotetag591" name="footnotetag591"></a><a href="#footnote591">[591]</a>
he was willing to give a dispensation for a marriage
between the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>(p. 213)</span>
Princess Mary and her half-brother, the Duke of
Richmond; the more insuperable the obstacle, the more its removal
enhanced his power. It was all very well to dispense with canons and
divine laws, but to annul papal dispensations&mdash;was that not to cheapen
his own wares? Why, wrote Henry to Clement, could he not dispense with
human laws, if he was able to dispense with divine at
pleasure?<a id="footnotetag592" name="footnotetag592"></a><a href="#footnote592">[592]</a>
Obviously because divine authority could take care of itself, but
papal prerogatives needed a careful shepherd. Even this principle,
such as it was, was not consistently followed, for he had annulled a
dispensation in Suffolk's case. Clement's real anxiety was to avoid
responsibility. More than once he urged Henry to settle the matter
himself,<a id="footnotetag593" name="footnotetag593"></a><a href="#footnote593">[593]</a>
as Suffolk had done, obtain a sentence from the courts
in England, and marry his second wife. The case could then only come
before him as a suit against the validity of the second marriage, and
the accomplished fact was always a powerful argument. Moreover, all
this would take time, and delay was as dear to Clement as
irresponsibility. But Henry was determined to have such a sentence as
would preclude all doubts of the legitimacy of his children by the
second marriage, and was as anxious to shift the responsibility to
Clement's shoulders as the Pope was to avoid it. Clement next urged
Catherine to go into a nunnery, for that would only entail injustice
on herself, and would involve the Church and its head in no temporal
perils.<a id="footnotetag594" name="footnotetag594"></a><a href="#footnote594">[594]</a>
When Catherine
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>(p. 214)</span>
refused, he wished her in the
grave, and lamented that he seemed doomed through her to lose the
spiritualties of his Church, as he had lost its temporalties through
her nephew, Charles
V.<a id="footnotetag595" name="footnotetag595"></a><a href="#footnote595">[595]</a></p>

<p>It was thus with the utmost reluctance that he granted the commission
brought by Knight. It was a draft, drawn up by Wolsey, apparently
declaring the law on the matter and empowering Wolsey, if the facts
were found to be such as were alleged, to pronounce the nullity of
Catherine's
marriage.<a id="footnotetag596" name="footnotetag596"></a><a href="#footnote596">[596]</a>
Wolsey desired that it should be granted in
the form in which he had drawn it up. But the Pope's advisers declared
that such a commission would disgrace Henry, Wolsey and Clement
himself. The draft was therefore amended so as to be unobjectionable,
or, in other words, useless for practical purposes; and, with this
commission, Knight returned to England, rejoicing in the confidence of
complete success. But, as soon as Wolsey had seen it, he pronounced
the commission "as good as none at
all".<a id="footnotetag597" name="footnotetag597"></a><a href="#footnote597">[597]</a>
The discovery did not
improve his or Henry's opinion of the Pope's good faith; but,
dissembling their resentment, they despatched, in February, 1528,
Stephen Gardiner and Edward Foxe to obtain fresh and more effective
powers. Eventually, on 8th June a commission was issued to Wolsey and
Campeggio to try the case and pronounce
sentence;<a id="footnotetag598" name="footnotetag598"></a><a href="#footnote598">[598]</a>
even if one was
unwilling, the other might act by himself; and all appeals from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>(p. 215)</span>
their jurisdiction were forbidden. This was not a decretal
commission; it did not bind the Pope or prevent him from revoking the
case. Such a commission was, however, granted on condition that it
should be shown to no one but the King and Wolsey, and that it should
not be used in the procedure. The Pope also gave a written promise, in
spite of a protest lodged on Catherine's behalf by the Spanish
ambassador,
Muxetula,<a id="footnotetag599" name="footnotetag599"></a><a href="#footnote599">[599]</a>
that he would not revoke, or do anything to
invalidate, the commission, but would confirm the cardinals'
decision.<a id="footnotetag600" name="footnotetag600"></a><a href="#footnote600">[600]</a>
If, Clement had said in the previous December, Lautrec,
the French commander in Italy, came nearer Rome, he might excuse
himself to the Emperor as having acted under
pressure.<a id="footnotetag601" name="footnotetag601"></a><a href="#footnote601">[601]</a>
He would
send the commission as soon as Lautrec arrived. Lautrec had now
arrived; he had marched down through Italy; he had captured Melfi; the
Spanish commander, Moncada, had been killed; Naples was thought to be
on the eve of
surrender.<a id="footnotetag602" name="footnotetag602"></a><a href="#footnote602">[602]</a>
The Spanish dominion in Italy was
waning, the Emperor's thunderbolts were less terrifying, and the
justice of the cause of his aunt less apparent.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>On 25th July Campeggio embarked at
Corneto,<a id="footnotetag603" name="footnotetag603"></a><a href="#footnote603">[603]</a>
and proceeded by slow
stages through France towards England. Henry congratulated himself
that his hopes were on the eve of fulfilment. But, unfortunately for
him, the basis, on which they were built, was as unstable as water.
The decision of his case still depended upon Clement, and Clement
wavered with every fluctuation in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>(p. 216)</span>
success or the failure
of the Spanish arms in Italy. Campeggio had scarcely set out, when
Doria, the famous Genoese admiral, deserted Francis for
Charles;<a id="footnotetag604" name="footnotetag604"></a><a href="#footnote604">[604]</a>
on the 17th of August Lautrec died before
Naples;<a id="footnotetag605" name="footnotetag605"></a><a href="#footnote605">[605]</a>
and, on 10th
September, an English agent sent Wolsey news of a French disaster,
which he thought more serious than the battle of Pavia or the sack of
Rome.<a id="footnotetag606" name="footnotetag606"></a><a href="#footnote606">[606]</a>
On the following day Sanga, the Pope's secretary, wrote to
Campeggio that, "as the Emperor is victorious, the Pope must not give
him any pretext for a fresh rupture, lest the Church should be utterly
annihilated.... Proceed on your journey to England, and there do your
utmost to restore mutual affection between the King and Queen. You are
not to pronounce any opinion without a new and express commission
hence."<a id="footnotetag607" name="footnotetag607"></a><a href="#footnote607">[607]</a>
Sanga repeated the injunction a few days later. "Every
day," he wrote, "stronger reasons are discovered;" to satisfy Henry
"involves the certain ruin of the Apostolic See and the Church, owing
to recent events.... If so great an injury be done to the Emperor...
the Church cannot escape utter ruin, as it is entirely in the power of
the Emperor's servants. You will not, therefore, be surprised at my
repeating that you are not to proceed to sentence, under any pretext,
without express commission; but to protract the matter as long as
possible."<a id="footnotetag608" name="footnotetag608"></a><a href="#footnote608">[608]</a>
Clement himself wrote to Charles that nothing would be
done to Catherine's detriment, that Campeggio had gone merely to urge
Henry to do his duty, and that the whole case would eventually be
referred to
Rome.<a id="footnotetag609" name="footnotetag609"></a><a href="#footnote609">[609]</a>
Such were the secret instructions with which
Campeggio
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>(p. 217)</span>
arrived in England in
October.<a id="footnotetag610" name="footnotetag610"></a><a href="#footnote610">[610]</a>
He readily
promised not to proceed to sentence, but protested against the
interpretation which he put upon the Pope's command, namely, that he
was not to begin the trial. The English, he said, "would think that I
had come to hoodwink them, and might resent it. You know how much that
would
involve."<a id="footnotetag611" name="footnotetag611"></a><a href="#footnote611">[611]</a>
He did not seem to realise that the refusal to
pass sentence was equally hoodwinking the English, and that the trial
would only defer the moment of their penetrating the deception; a
trial was of no use without sentence.</p>

<p>In accordance with his instructions, Campeggio first sought to
dissuade Henry from persisting in his suit for the divorce. Finding
the King immovable, he endeavoured to induce Catherine to go into a
nunnery, as the divorced wife of Louis XII. had done, "who still lived
in the greatest honour and reputation with God and all that
kingdom".<a id="footnotetag612" name="footnotetag612"></a><a href="#footnote612">[612]</a>
He represented to her that she had nothing to lose by
such a step; she could never regain Henry's affections or obtain
restitution of her conjugal rights. Her consent might have deferred
the separation of the English Church from Rome; it would certainly
have relieved the Supreme Pontiff from a humiliating and intolerable
position. But these considerations of expediency weighed nothing with
Catherine. She was as immovable as Henry, and deaf to all Campeggio's
solicitations. Her conscience was, perhaps, of a rigid, Spanish type,
but it was as clear as Henry's and a great deal more comprehensible.
She was convinced that her marriage was valid; to admit a doubt of it
would imply that she had been living in sin and imperil her immortal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>(p. 218)</span>
soul. Henry did not in the least mind admitting that he had
lived for twenty years with a woman who was not his wife; the sin, to
his mind, was continuing to live with her after he had become
convinced that she was really not his wife. Catherine appears,
however, to have been willing to take the monastic vows, if Henry
would do the same. Henry was equally willing, if Clement would
immediately dispense with the vows in his case, but not in
Catherine's.<a id="footnotetag613" name="footnotetag613"></a><a href="#footnote613">[613]</a>
But there were objections to this course, and doubts
of Clement's power to authorise Henry's re-marriage, even if Catherine
did go into a nunnery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Campeggio found help from an unexpected quarter in his
efforts to waste the time. Quite unknown to Henry, Wolsey, or Clement,
there existed in Spain a brief of Julius II. fuller than the original
bull of dispensation which he had granted for the marriage of Henry
and Catherine, and supplying any defects that might be found in it.
Indeed, so conveniently did the brief meet the criticisms urged
against the bull, that Henry and Wolsey at once pronounced it an
obvious forgery, concocted after the doubts about the bull had been
raised. No copy of the brief could be found in the English archives,
nor could any trace be discovered of its having been registered at
Rome; while Ghinucci and Lee, who examined the original in Spain,
professed to see in it such flagrant inaccuracies as to deprive it of
all claim to be
genuine.<a id="footnotetag614" name="footnotetag614"></a><a href="#footnote614">[614]</a>
Still, if it were genuine, it shattered
the whole of Henry's case.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>(p. 219)</span>
That had been built up, not on
the denial of the Pope's power to dispense, but on the technical
defects of a particular dispensation. Now it appeared that the
validity of the marriage did not depend upon this dispensation at all.
Nor did it depend upon the brief, for Catherine was prepared to deny
on oath that the marriage with Arthur had been anything more than a
form;<a id="footnotetag615" name="footnotetag615"></a><a href="#footnote615">[615]</a>
in that case the affinity with Henry had not been
contracted, and there was no need of either dispensation or brief.
This assertion seems to have shaken Henry; certainly he began to shift
his position, and, early in 1529, he was wishing for some noted
divine, friar or other, who would maintain that the Pope could not
dispense at
all.<a id="footnotetag616" name="footnotetag616"></a><a href="#footnote616">[616]</a>
This was his first doubt as to the plenitude of
papal power; his marriage with Catherine must be invalid, because his
conscience told him so; if it was not invalid through defects in the
dispensation, it must be invalid because the Pope could not dispense.
Wolsey met the objection with a legal point, perfectly good in itself,
but trivial. There were two canonical disabilities which the
dispensation must meet for Henry's marriage to be valid; first, the
consummation of Catherine's marriage with Arthur; secondly, the
marriage, even though it was not consummated, was yet celebrated <i>in
facie ecclesiæ</i>, and generally reputed complete. There was thus an
<i>impedimentum publicæ honestatis</i> to the marriage of Henry and
Catherine, and this impediment was not mentioned in, and therefore not
removed by, the
dispensation.<a id="footnotetag617" name="footnotetag617"></a><a href="#footnote617">[617]</a></p>

<p>But
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>(p. 220)</span>
all this legal argument might be invalidated by the
brief. It was useless to proceed with the trial until the promoters of
the suit knew what the brief contained. According to Mendoza,
Catherine's "whole right" depended upon the brief, a statement
indicating a general suspicion that the bull was really
insufficient.<a id="footnotetag618" name="footnotetag618"></a><a href="#footnote618">[618]</a>
So the winter of 1528-29 and the following spring
were spent in efforts to get hold of the original brief, or to induce
Clement to declare it a forgery. The Queen was made to write to
Charles that it was absolutely essential to her case that the brief
should be produced before the legatine Court in
England.<a id="footnotetag619" name="footnotetag619"></a><a href="#footnote619">[619]</a>
The
Emperor was not likely to be caught by so transparent an artifice.
Moreover, the emissary, sent with Catherine's letter, wrote, as soon
as he got to France, warning Charles that his aunt's letter was
written under compulsion and expressed the reverse of her real
desires.<a id="footnotetag620" name="footnotetag620"></a><a href="#footnote620">[620]</a>
In the spring of 1529 several English envoys, ending
with Gardiner, were sent to Rome to obtain a papal declaration of the
falsity of the brief. Clement, however, naturally refused to declare
the brief a forgery, without hearing the arguments on the other
side,<a id="footnotetag621" name="footnotetag621"></a><a href="#footnote621">[621]</a>
and more important developments soon supervened. Gardiner
wrote from Rome, early in May, that there was imminent danger of the
Pope revoking the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>(p. 221)</span>
case, and the news determined Henry and
Wolsey to relinquish their suit about the brief, and push on the
proceedings of the legatine Court, so as to get some decision before
the case was called to Rome. Once the legates had pronounced in favour
of the divorce, Clement was informed, the English cared little what
further fortunes befel it elsewhere.</p>

<p>So, on the 31st of May, 1529, in the great hall of the Black Friars,
in London, the famous Court was formally opened, and the King and
Queen were cited to appear before it on the 18th of
June.<a id="footnotetag622" name="footnotetag622"></a><a href="#footnote622">[622]</a>
Henry
was then represented by two proxies, but Catherine came in person to
protest against the competence of the
tribunal.<a id="footnotetag623" name="footnotetag623"></a><a href="#footnote623">[623]</a>
Three days later
both the King and the Queen attended in person to hear the Court's
decision on this point. Catherine threw herself on her knees before
Henry; she begged him to consider her honour, her daughter's and his.
Twice Henry raised her up; he protested that he desired nothing so
much as that their marriage should be found valid, in spite of the
"perpetual scruple" he had felt about it, and declared that only his
love for her had kept him silent so long; her request for the removal
of the cause to Rome was unreasonable, considering the Emperor's power
there. Again protesting against the jurisdiction of the Court and
appealing to Rome, Catherine withdrew. Touched by her appeal, Henry
burst out in her praise. "She is, my Lords," he said, "as true, as
obedient, and as conformable a wife, as I could, in my phantasy, wish
or desire. She hath all the virtuous qualities that ought to be in a
woman of her dignity, or in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>(p. 222)</span>
any other of baser
estate."<a id="footnotetag624" name="footnotetag624"></a><a href="#footnote624">[624]</a>
But these qualities had nothing to do with the pitiless forms of law.
The legate, overruled her protest, refused her appeal, and summoned
her back. She took no notice, and was declared contumacious.</p>

<p>The proceedings then went on without her; Fisher Bishop of Rochester,
made a courageous defence of the validity of the marriage, to which
Henry drew up a bitter reply in the form of a speech addressed to the
legates.<a id="footnotetag625" name="footnotetag625"></a><a href="#footnote625">[625]</a>
The speed with which the procedure was hurried on was
little to Campeggio's taste. He had not prejudged the case; he was
still in doubt as to which way the sentence would go; and he entered a
dignified protest against the orders he received from Rome to give
sentence, if it came to that point, against
Henry.<a id="footnotetag626" name="footnotetag626"></a><a href="#footnote626">[626]</a>
He would
pronounce what judgment seemed to him just, but he shrank from the
ordeal, and he did his best to follow out Clement's injunctions to
procrastinate.<a id="footnotetag627" name="footnotetag627"></a><a href="#footnote627">[627]</a>
In this he succeeded completely. It seemed that
judgment could no longer be deferred; it was to be delivered on the
23rd of
July.<a id="footnotetag628" name="footnotetag628"></a><a href="#footnote628">[628]</a>
On that day the King himself, and the chief men of
his Court, were present; his proctor demanded sentence. Campeggio
stood up, and instead of giving sentence, adjourned the Court till
October.<a id="footnotetag629" name="footnotetag629"></a><a href="#footnote629">[629]</a>
"By the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>(p. 223)</span>
mass!" burst out Suffolk, giving the
table a great blow with his hand, "now I see that the old-said saw is
true, that there was never a legate nor cardinal that did good in
England." The Court never met again; and except during the transient
reaction, under Mary, it was the last legatine Court ever held in
England. They might assure the Pope, Wolsey had written to the English
envoys at Rome a month before, that if he granted the revocation he
would lose the devotion of the King and of England to the See
Apostolic, and utterly destroy Wolsey for
ever.<a id="footnotetag630" name="footnotetag630"></a><a href="#footnote630">[630]</a></p>

<p>Long before the vacation was ended, news reached Henry that the case
had been called to Rome; the revocation was, indeed, decreed a week
before Campeggio adjourned his court. Charles's star, once more in the
ascendant, had cast its baleful influence over Henry's fortunes. The
close alliance between England and France had led to a joint
declaration of war on the Emperor in January, 1528, into which the
English ambassadors in Spain had been inveigled by their French
colleagues, against Henry's
wishes.<a id="footnotetag631" name="footnotetag631"></a><a href="#footnote631">[631]</a>
It was received with a storm
of opposition in England, and Wolsey had some difficulty in justifying
himself to the King. "You may be sure," wrote Du Bellay, "that he is
playing a terrible game, for I believe he is the only Englishman who
wishes a war with
Flanders."<a id="footnotetag632" name="footnotetag632"></a><a href="#footnote632">[632]</a>
If that was his wish, he was doomed
to disappointment. Popular hatred of the war was too strong; a project
was mooted by the clothiers in Kent for seizing the Cardinal and
turning him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>(p. 224)</span>
adrift in a boat, with holes bored in
it.<a id="footnotetag633" name="footnotetag633"></a><a href="#footnote633">[633]</a>
The clothiers in Wiltshire were reported to be rising; in Norfolk
employers dismissed their
workmen.<a id="footnotetag634" name="footnotetag634"></a><a href="#footnote634">[634]</a>
War with Flanders meant ruin
to the most prosperous industry in both countries, and the attempt to
divert the Flanders trade to Calais had
failed.<a id="footnotetag635" name="footnotetag635"></a><a href="#footnote635">[635]</a>
So Henry and
Charles were soon discussing peace; no hostilities took place; an
agreement, that trade should go on as usual with
Flanders,<a id="footnotetag636" name="footnotetag636"></a><a href="#footnote636">[636]</a>
was
followed by a truce in
June,<a id="footnotetag637" name="footnotetag637"></a><a href="#footnote637">[637]</a>
and the truce by the Peace of
Cambrai in the following year. That peace affords the measure of
England's decline since 1521. Wolsey was carefully excluded from all
share in the negotiations. England was, indeed, admitted as a
participator, but only after Louise and Margaret of Savoy had
practically settled the terms, and after Du Bellay had told Francis
that, if England were not admitted, it would mean Wolsey's immediate
ruin.<a id="footnotetag638" name="footnotetag638"></a><a href="#footnote638">[638]</a></p>

<p>By the Treaty of Cambrai Francis abandoned Italy to Charles. His
affairs beyond the Alps had been going from bad to worse since the
death of Lautrec; and the suggested guard of French and English
soldiers which was to relieve the Pope from fear of Charles was never
formed.<a id="footnotetag639" name="footnotetag639"></a><a href="#footnote639">[639]</a>
That failure was not the only circumstance which made
Clement imperialist. Venice, the ally of England and France, seized
Ravenna and Cervia, two papal
towns.<a id="footnotetag640" name="footnotetag640"></a><a href="#footnote640">[640]</a>
"The conduct of the
Venetians," wrote John Casale from Rome, "moves the Pope more than
anything else, and he would use the assistance of any one, except
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225"></a>(p. 225)</span>
the Devil, to avenge their
injury."<a id="footnotetag641" name="footnotetag641"></a><a href="#footnote641">[641]</a>
"The King and the
Cardinal," repeated Sanga to Campeggio, "must not expect him to
execute his intentions, until they have used their utmost efforts to
compel the Venetians to restore the Pope's
territories."<a id="footnotetag642" name="footnotetag642"></a><a href="#footnote642">[642]</a>
Henry
did his best, but he was not sincerely helped by Francis; his efforts
proved vain, and Clement thought he could get more effective
assistance from Charles. "Every one is persuaded," said one of the
Emperor's agents in Italy on 10th January, 1529, "that the Pope is now
sincerely attached to his Imperial
Majesty."<a id="footnotetag643" name="footnotetag643"></a><a href="#footnote643">[643]</a>
"I suspect," wrote
Du Bellay from London, in the same month, "that the Pope has commanded
Campeggio to meddle no further, seeing things are taking quite a
different turn from what he had been assured, and that the Emperor's
affairs in Naples are in such a state that Clement dare not displease
him."<a id="footnotetag644" name="footnotetag644"></a><a href="#footnote644">[644]</a>
The Pope had already informed Charles that his aunt's
petition for the revocation of the suit would be
granted.<a id="footnotetag645" name="footnotetag645"></a><a href="#footnote645">[645]</a>
The
Italian League was practically dissolved. "I have quite made up my
mind," said Clement to the Archbishop of Capua on 7th June, "to become
an Imperialist, and to live and die as such... I am only waiting for
the return of my
nuncio."<a id="footnotetag646" name="footnotetag646"></a><a href="#footnote646">[646]</a></p>

<p>That nuncio had gone to Barcelona to negotiate an alliance between the
Pope and the Emperor; and the success of his mission completed
Clement's conversion. The revocation was only delayed, thought
Charles's representative at Rome, to secure better terms for the
Pope.<a id="footnotetag647" name="footnotetag647"></a><a href="#footnote647">[647]</a>
On 21st June, the French commander, St. Pol, was utterly
defeated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name="page226"></a>(p. 226)</span>
at Landriano; "not a vestige of the army is left,"
reported
Casale.<a id="footnotetag648" name="footnotetag648"></a><a href="#footnote648">[648]</a>
A few days later the Treaty of Barcelona between
Clement and Charles was
signed.<a id="footnotetag649" name="footnotetag649"></a><a href="#footnote649">[649]</a>
Clement's nephew was to marry the
Emperor's natural daughter; the Medici tyranny was to be
re-established in Florence; Ravenna, Cervia and other towns were to be
restored to the Pope; His Holiness was to crown Charles with the
imperial crown, and to absolve from ecclesiastical censures all those
who were present at, or consented to, the sack of Rome. It was, in
effect, a family compact; and part of it was the quashing of the
legates' proceedings against the Emperor's aunt, with whom the Pope
was now to be allied by family ties. "We found out secretly," write
the English envoys at Rome, on the 16th of July, "that the Pope signed
the revocation yesterday morning, as it would have been dishonourable
to have signed it after the publication of the new treaty with the
Emperor, which will be published here on
Sunday."<a id="footnotetag650" name="footnotetag650"></a><a href="#footnote650">[650]</a>
Clement knew
that his motives would not bear scrutiny, and he tried to avoid public
odium by a characteristic subterfuge. Catherine could hope for no
justice in England, Henry could expect no justice at Rome. Political
expediency would dictate a verdict in Henry's favour in England;
political expediency would dictate a verdict for Catherine at Rome.
Henry's ambassadors were instructed to appeal from Clement to the
"true Vicar of Christ," but where was the true Vicar of Christ
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>(p. 227)</span>
to be found on
earth?<a id="footnotetag651" name="footnotetag651"></a><a href="#footnote651">[651]</a>
There was no higher tribunal. It was
intolerable that English suits should be decided by the chances and
changes of French or Habsburg influence in Italy, by the hopes and the
fears of an Italian prince for the safety of his temporal power. The
natural and inevitable result was the separation of England from Rome.</p>




<h3>CHAPTER IX.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>(p. 228)</span></h3>

<h4>THE CARDINAL'S FALL.<a id="footnotetag652" name="footnotetag652"></a><a href="#footnote652">[652]</a></h4>


<p>The loss of their spiritual jurisdiction in England was part of the
price paid by the Popes for their temporal possessions in Italy. The
papal domains were either too great or too small. If the Pope was to
rely on his temporal power, it should have been extensive enough to
protect him from the dictation and resentment of secular princes; and
from this point of view there was no little justification for the aims
of Julius II. Had he succeeded in driving the barbarians across the
Alps or into the sea, he and his successors might in safety have
judged the world, and the breach with Henry might never have taken
place. If the Pope was to rely on his spiritual weapons, there was no
need of temporal states at all. In their existing extent and position,
they were simply the heel of Achilles, the vulnerable spot, through
which secular foes might wound the Vicar of Christ. France threatened
him from the north and Spain from the south; he was ever between the
upper and the nether mill-stone. Italy was the cockpit of Europe in
the sixteenth century, and the eyes of the Popes were perpetually bent
on the worldly fray, seeking to save or extend their dominions.
Through the Pope's temporal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>(p. 229)</span>
power, France and Spain exerted
their pressure. He could only defend himself by playing off one
against the other, and in this game his spiritual powers were his only
effective pieces. More and more the spiritual authority, with which he
was entrusted, was made to serve political ends. Temporal princes were
branded as "sons of iniquity and children of perdition," not because
their beliefs or their morals were worse than other men's, but because
they stood in the way of the family ambitions of various popes. Their
frequent use and abuse brought ecclesiastical censures into public
contempt, and princes soon ceased to be frightened with false fires.
James IV., when excommunicated, said he would appeal to Prester John,
and that he would side with any council against the Pope, even if it
contained only three
bishops.<a id="footnotetag653" name="footnotetag653"></a><a href="#footnote653">[653]</a>
The Vicar of Christ was lost in the
petty Italian prince. <i>Corruptio optimi pessima</i>. The lower dragged
the higher nature down. If the Papal Court was distinguished from the
courts of other Italian sovereigns, it was not by exceptional purity.
"In this Court as in others," wrote Silvester de Giglis from Rome,
"nothing can be effected without
gifts."<a id="footnotetag654" name="footnotetag654"></a><a href="#footnote654">[654]</a>
The election of Leo X.
was said to be free from bribery; a cardinal himself was amazed, and
described the event as <i>Ph&oelig;nix et rara
avis</i>.<a id="footnotetag655" name="footnotetag655"></a><a href="#footnote655">[655]</a>
If poison was
not a frequent weapon at Rome, popes and cardinals at least believed
it to be. Alexander VI. was said to have been poisoned; one cardinal
was accused of poisoning his fellow-cardinal, Bainbridge; and others
were charged with an attempt on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>(p. 230)</span>
the life of Leo
X.<a id="footnotetag656" name="footnotetag656"></a><a href="#footnote656">[656]</a> In
1517, Pace described the state of affairs at Rome as <i>plane monstra,
omni dedecore et infamia plena; omnis fides, omnis honestas, una cum
religione, a mundo abvolasse
videntur</i>.<a id="footnotetag657" name="footnotetag657"></a><a href="#footnote657">[657]</a>
Ten years later, the
Emperor himself declared that the sack of Rome was the just judgment
of God, and one of his ambassadors said that the Pope ought to be
deprived of his temporal states, as they had been at the bottom of all
the
dissensions.<a id="footnotetag658" name="footnotetag658"></a><a href="#footnote658">[658]</a>
Clement himself claimed to have been the
originator of that war which brought upon him so terrible and so just
a punishment.</p>

<p>Another result of the merging of the Pope in the Italian prince was
the practical exclusion of the English and other Northern nations from
the supreme council of Christendom. There was no apparent reason why
an Englishman should not be the head of the Christian Church just as
well as an Italian; but there was some incongruity in the idea of an
Englishman ruling over Italian States, and no Englishman had attained
the Papacy for nearly four centuries. The double failure of Wolsey
made it clear that the door of the Papacy was sealed to Englishmen,
whatever their claims might be. The roll of cardinals tells a similar
tale; the Roman curia graciously conceded that there should generally
be one English cardinal in the sacred college, but one in a body
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>(p. 231)</span>
of forty or fifty was thought as much as England could fairly
demand. It is not so very surprising that England repudiated the
authority of a tribunal in which its influence was measured on such a
contemptible scale. The other nations of Europe thought much the same,
and it is only necessary to add up the number of cardinals belonging
to each nationality to arrive at a fairly accurate indication of the
peoples who rejected papal pretensions. The nations most inadequately
represented in the college of cardinals broke away from Rome; those
which remained faithful were the nations which controlled in the
present, or might hope to control in the future, the supreme
ecclesiastical power. Spain and France had little temptation to
abolish an authority which they themselves wielded in turn; for if the
Pope was a Spaniard to-day, he might well be a Frenchman to-morrow.
There was no absurdity in Frenchmen or Spaniards ruling over the papal
States; for France and Spain already held under their sway more
Italian territory than Italian natives themselves. It was the
subjection of the Pope to French and Spanish domination that
prejudiced his claims in English eyes. His authority was tolerable so
long as the old ideal of the unity of Christendom under a single
monarch retained its force, or even so long as the Pope was Italian
pure and simple. But when Italy was either Spanish or French, and the
Pope the chaplain of one or the other monarch, the growing spirit of
nationality could bear it no longer; it responded at once to Henry's
appeals against the claims of a foreign jurisdiction.</p>

<p>It was a mere accident that the breach with Rome grew out of Spanish
control of the Pope. The separation was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>(p. 232)</span>
nearly effected more
than a century earlier, as a result of the Pope's Babylonish captivity
in France; and the wonder is, not that the breach took place when it
did, but that it was deferred for so long. At the beginning of the
fifteenth century all the elements were present but one for the
ecclesiastical revolution which was reserved for Henry VIII. to
effect. The Papacy had been discredited in English eyes by
subservience to France, just as it had in 1529 by subservience to
Charles. Lollardy was more powerful in England in the reign of Henry
IV. than heresy was in the middle of that of Henry VIII. There was as
strong a demand for the secularisation of Church property on the part
of the lay peers and gentry; and Wycliffe himself had anticipated the
cardinal point of the later movement by appealing to the State to
reform the Church. But great revolutions depend on a number of causes
working together, and often fail for the lack of one. The element
lacking in the reign of Henry IV. was the King himself. The
Lancastrians were orthodox from conviction and from the necessities of
their position; they needed the support of the Church to bolster up a
weak title to the crown. The civil wars followed; and Henry VII. was
too much absorbed in securing his throne to pursue any quarrels with
Rome. But when his son began to rule as well as to reign, it was
inevitable that not merely questions of Church property and of the
relations with the Papacy should come up for revision, but also those
issues between Church and State which had remained in abeyance during
the fifteenth century. The divorce was the spark which ignited the
flame, but the combustible materials had been long existent. If the
divorce had been all, there would have been no Reformation in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233"></a>(p. 233)</span>
England. After the death of Anne Boleyn, Henry might have done
some trifling penance at his subjects' expense, made the Pope a
present, or waged war on one of Clement's orthodox foes, and that
would have been the end. Much had happened since the days of
Hildebrand, and Popes were no longer able to exact heroic repentance.
The divorce, in fact, was the occasion, and not the cause, of the
Reformation.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>That movement, so far as Henry VIII. was concerned, was not in essence
doctrinal; neither was it primarily a schism between the English and
Roman communions. It was rather an episode in the eternal dispute
between Church and State. Throughout the quarrel, Henry and Elizabeth
maintained that they were merely reasserting their ancient royal
prerogative over the Church, which the Pope of Rome had usurped.
English revolutions have always been based on specious conservative
pleas, and the only method of inducing Englishmen to change has been
by persuasions that the change is not a change at all, or is a change
to an older and better order. The Parliaments of the seventeenth
century regarded the Stuart pretensions, as Henry and Elizabeth did
those of the Pope, in the light of usurpations upon their own
imprescriptible rights; and more recently, movements to make the
Church Catholic have been based on the ground that it has never been
anything else. The Tudor contention that the State was always supreme
over the Church has been transformed into a theory that the Church was
always at least semi-independent of Rome. But it is not so clear that
the Church has always been anti-papal, as that the English laity have
always been anti-clerical.</p>

<p>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>(p. 234)</span>
English people were certainly
very anti-sacerdotal from the very beginning of Henry VIII.'s reign.
In 1512 James IV. complained to Henry that Englishmen seized Scots
merchants, ill-treated them, and abused them as "the Pope's
men".<a id="footnotetag659" name="footnotetag659"></a><a href="#footnote659">[659]</a>
At the end of the same year Parliament deprived of their benefit of
clergy all clerks under the rank of sub-deacon who committed murder or
felony.<a id="footnotetag660" name="footnotetag660"></a><a href="#footnote660">[660]</a>
This measure at once provoked a cry of "the Church in
danger". The Abbot of Winchcombe preached that the act was contrary to
the law of God and to the liberties of the Church, and that the lords,
who consented thereto, had incurred a liability to spiritual censures.
Standish, warden of the Mendicant Friars of London, defended the
action of Parliament, while the temporal peers requested the bishops
to make the Abbot of Winchcombe
recant.<a id="footnotetag661" name="footnotetag661"></a><a href="#footnote661">[661]</a>
They refused, and, at the
Convocation of 1515, Standish was summoned before it to explain his
conduct. He appealed to the King; the judges pronounced that all who
had taken part in the proceedings against Standish had incurred the
penalties of <i>præmunire</i>. They also declared that the King could hold
a Parliament without the spiritual lords, who only sat in virtue of
their temporalties. This opinion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235"></a>(p. 235)</span>
seems to have nothing to do
with the dispute, but it is remarkable that, in one list of the peers
attending the Parliament of 1515, there is not a single
abbot.<a id="footnotetag662" name="footnotetag662"></a><a href="#footnote662">[662]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the Abbot of Winchcombe and Friar Standish, the
prelates claimed the same liberty of speech for Convocation as was
enjoyed by Parliament; so that they could, without offence, have
maintained certain acts of Parliament to be against the laws of the
Church.<a id="footnotetag663" name="footnotetag663"></a><a href="#footnote663">[663]</a>
Wolsey interceded on their behalf, and begged that the
matter might be left to the Pope's decision, while Henry contented
himself with a declaration that he would maintain intact his royal
jurisdiction. This was not all that passed during that session of
Parliament and Convocation. At the end of his summary of the
proceedings, Dr. John Taylor, who was both clerk of Parliament and
prolocutor of Convocation, remarks: "In this Parliament and
Convocation the most dangerous quarrels broke out between the clergy
and the secular power, respecting the Church's
liberties";<a id="footnotetag664" name="footnotetag664"></a><a href="#footnote664">[664]</a>
and
there exists a remarkable petition presented to this Parliament
against clerical exactions; it complained that the clergy refused
burial until after the gift of the deceased's best jewel, best garment
or the like, and demanded that every curate should administer the
sacrament when required to do
so.<a id="footnotetag665" name="footnotetag665"></a><a href="#footnote665">[665]</a>
It was no wonder that Wolsey
advised "the more speedy dissolution" of this
Parliament,<a id="footnotetag666" name="footnotetag666"></a><a href="#footnote666">[666]</a>
and
that, except in 1523, when financial straits compelled him, he did not
call another while he remained in power. His fall was the sign
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236"></a>(p. 236)</span>
for the revival of Parliament, and it immediately took up the
work where it was left in 1515.</p>

<p>These significant proceedings did not stand alone. In 1515 the Bishop
of London's chancellor was indicted for the murder of a citizen who
had been found dead in the Bishop's
prison.<a id="footnotetag667" name="footnotetag667"></a><a href="#footnote667">[667]</a>
The Bishop interceded
with Wolsey to prevent the trial; any London jury would, he said,
convict any clerk, "be he innocent as Abel; they be so maliciously set
<i>in favorem hæreticæ
pravitatis</i>".<a id="footnotetag668" name="footnotetag668"></a><a href="#footnote668">[668]</a>
The heresy was no matter of
belief, but hatred of clerical immunities. The <i>Epistolæ Obscurorum
Virorum</i>, wrote More to Erasmus in 1516, was "popular
everywhere";<a id="footnotetag669" name="footnotetag669"></a><a href="#footnote669">[669]</a>
and no more bitter a satire had yet been penned on
the clergy. In this matter Henry and his lay subjects were at one.
Standish, whom Taylor describes as the promoter and instigator of all
these evils, was a favourite preacher at Henry's Court. The King, said
Pace, had "often praised his
doctrine".<a id="footnotetag670" name="footnotetag670"></a><a href="#footnote670">[670]</a>
But what was it? It was
no advocacy of Henry's loved "new learning," for Standish denounced
the Greek Testament of Erasmus, and is held up to ridicule by the
great Dutch
humanist;<a id="footnotetag671" name="footnotetag671"></a><a href="#footnote671">[671]</a>
Standish, too, was afterwards a stout
defender of the Pope's dispensing power, and followed Fisher in his
protest against the divorce before the legatine Court. The doctrine,
which pleased the King so much, was Standish's denial of clerical
immunity from State control, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>(p. 237)</span>
his assertion of royal
prerogatives over the Church. In 1518 the Bishopric of St. Asaph's
fell vacant. Wolsey, who was then at the height of his power,
recommended
Bolton,<a id="footnotetag672" name="footnotetag672"></a><a href="#footnote672">[672]</a>
prior of St. Bartholomew's, a learned man;
but Henry was resolved to reward his favourite divine, and Standish
obtained the see. Pace, a good churchman, expressed himself to Wolsey
as "mortified" at the result, but said it was inevitable, as besides
the King's good graces, Standish enjoyed "the favour of all the
courtiers for the singular assistance he has rendered towards
subverting the Church of
England".<a id="footnotetag673" name="footnotetag673"></a><a href="#footnote673">[673]</a></p>

<p>Eleven more years were to roll before the Church was subverted. They
were years of Wolsey's supremacy; he alone stood between the Church
and its subjection. It was owing, wrote Campeggio, in 1528, to
Wolsey's vigilance and solicitude that the Holy See retained its rank
and dignity.<a id="footnotetag674" name="footnotetag674"></a><a href="#footnote674">[674]</a>
His ruin would drag down the Church, and the fact
was known to Anne Boleyn and her faction, to Campeggio and Clement
VII., as well as to Henry
VIII.<a id="footnotetag675" name="footnotetag675"></a><a href="#footnote675">[675]</a>
"These Lords intend," wrote Du
Bellay, on the eve of Wolsey's fall, "after he is dead or ruined, to
impeach the State of the Church, and take all its goods; which it is
hardly needful for me to write in cipher, for they proclaim it openly.
I expect they will do fine
miracles."<a id="footnotetag676" name="footnotetag676"></a><a href="#footnote676">[676]</a>
A few days later he says,
"I expect the priests will never have the great seal again; and that
in this Parliament they will have terrible alarms. I think Dr. Stephen
(Gardiner) will have a good deal to do with the management of affairs,
<i>especially if he will abandon his
order</i>."<a id="footnotetag677" name="footnotetag677"></a><a href="#footnote677">[677]</a>
At Easter, 1529,
Lutheran books were circulating in Henry's Court,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>(p. 238)</span>
advocating
the confiscation of ecclesiastical property and the restoration of his
Church to its primitive simplicity. Campeggio warned the King against
them and maintained that it had been determined by councils and
theologians that the Church justly held her temporalties. Henry
retorted that according to the Lutherans "those decisions were arrived
at by ecclesiastics and now it was necessary for the laity to
interpose".<a id="footnotetag678" name="footnotetag678"></a><a href="#footnote678">[678]</a>
In his last interview with Henry, Campeggio "alluded
to this Parliament, which is about to be holden, and I earnestly
pressed upon him the liberty of the Church. He certainly seemed to me
very well disposed to exert his power to the
utmost."<a id="footnotetag679" name="footnotetag679"></a><a href="#footnote679">[679]</a>
"Down with
the Church" was going to be the Parliament cry. Whether Henry would
really "exert his power" to maintain her liberties remained to be
seen, but there never was a flimsier theory than that the divorce of
Catherine was the sole cause of the break with Rome. The centrifugal
forces were quite independent of the divorce; its historical
importance lies in the fact that it alienated from Rome the only power
in England which might have kept them in check. So long as Wolsey and
the clerical statesmen, with whom he surrounded the King, remained
supreme, the Church was comparatively safe. But Wolsey depended
entirely on Henry's support; when that was withdrawn, Church and
Cardinal fell together.</p>

<p>Wolsey's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>(p. 239)</span>
ruin was, however, due to more causes than his
failure to get a divorce for the King. It was at bottom the result of
the natural development of Henry's character. Egotism was from the
first his most prominent trait; it was inevitably fostered by the
extravagant adulation paid to Tudor sovereigns, and was further
encouraged by his realisation, first of his own mental powers, and
then of the extent to which he could force his will upon others. He
could never brook a rival in whatever sphere he wished to excel. In
the days of his youth he was absorbed in physical sports, in gorgeous
pageantry and ceremonial; he was content with such exhibitions as
prancing before the ladies between every course in a tourney, or
acting as pilot on board ship, blowing a whistle as loud as a trumpet,
and arrayed in trousers of cloth of gold. Gradually, as time wore on,
the athletic mania wore off, and pursuits, such as architecture, took
the place of physical sports. A generation later, a writer describes
Henry as "the only Ph&oelig;nix of his time for fine and curious
masonry".<a id="footnotetag680" name="footnotetag680"></a><a href="#footnote680">[680]</a>
From his own original designs York House was
transformed into Whitehall Palace, Nonsuch Palace was built, and
extensive alterations were made at Greenwich and Hampton Court.</p>

<p>But architecture was only a trifle; Henry's uncontrollable activity
also broke out in political spheres, and the eruption was fatal to
Wolsey's predominance. The King was still in the full vigour of
manhood; he had not reached his fortieth year, and his physical graces
were the marvel of those who saw him for the first time. Falier, the
new Venetian ambassador, who arrived in England
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>(p. 240)</span>
in 1529, is
as rapturous over the King's personal attractions as Giustinian or
Pasqualigo had been. "In this Eighth Henry," he writes, "God has
combined such corporeal and intellectual beauty as not merely to
surprise but astound all men.... His face is angelic (nine years
before a Frenchman had called it "feminine"), rather than handsome;
his head imperial and bold; and he wears a beard, contrary to the
English custom. Who would not be amazed, when contemplating such
singular beauty of person, coupled with such bold address, adapting
itself with the greatest ease to every manly
exercise?"<a id="footnotetag681" name="footnotetag681"></a><a href="#footnote681">[681]</a>
But
Henry's physique was no longer proof against every ailment; frequent
mention is made about this time of
headaches<a id="footnotetag682" name="footnotetag682"></a><a href="#footnote682">[682]</a>
which incapacitated
him from business, and it was not long before there appeared on his
leg the fistula which racked him with pain till the end of his life,
and eventually caused his death.</p>

<p>The divorce and the insuperable obstacles, which he discovered in
attaining the end he thought easy at first, did more to harden Henry's
temper than any bodily ills. He became a really serious man, and
developed that extraordinary power of self-control which stood him in
good stead in his later years. Naturally a man of violent passions, he
could never have steered clear of the dangers that beset him without
unusual capacity for curbing his temper, concealing his intentions,
and keeping his own counsel. Ministers might flatter themselves that
they could read his mind and calculate his actions, but it is quite
certain that henceforth no minister read so clearly his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>(p. 241)</span>
master's mind as the master did his minister's. "Three may keep
counsel," said the King in
1530,<a id="footnotetag683" name="footnotetag683"></a><a href="#footnote683">[683]</a>
"if two be away; and if I
thought that my cap knew my counsel, I would cast it into the fire and
burn it." "Never," comments a modern
writer,<a id="footnotetag684" name="footnotetag684"></a><a href="#footnote684">[684]</a>
"had the King spoken
a truer word, or described himself more accurately. Few would have
thought that, under so careless and splendid an exterior&mdash;the very
ideal of bluff, open-hearted good-humour and frankness&mdash;there lay a
watchful and secret eye, that marked what was going on, without
appearing to mark it; kept its own counsel until it was time to
strike, and then struck, as suddenly and remorselessly as a beast of
prey. It was strange to witness so much subtlety, combined with so
much strength."</p>

<p>In spite of his remorseless blows and arbitrary temper, Henry was too
shrewd and too great a man to despise the counsel of others, or think
any worse of an adviser because his advice differed from his own. He
loved to meet argument with argument, even when he might command. To
the end of his days he valued a councillor who would honestly maintain
the opposite of what the King desired. These councillors to whom he
gave his confidence were never minions or servile flatterers. Henry
had his Court favourites with whom he hunted and shot and diced; with
whom he played&mdash;always for money&mdash;tennis, primero and bowls, and the
more mysterious games of Pope July, Imperial and
Shovelboard;<a id="footnotetag685" name="footnotetag685"></a><a href="#footnote685">[685]</a>
and
to whom he threw many an acre of choice monastic land. But they never
influenced his policy. No man was ever advanced
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>(p. 242)</span>
to political
power in Henry's reign, merely because he pandered to the King's
vanity or to his vices. No one was a better judge of conduct in the
case of others, or a sterner champion of moral probity, when it did
not conflict with his own desires or conscience. In 1528 Anne Boleyn
and her friends were anxious to make a relative abbess of
Wilton.<a id="footnotetag686" name="footnotetag686"></a><a href="#footnote686">[686]</a>
But she had been notoriously unchaste. "Wherefore," wrote Henry to
Anne herself, "I would not, for all the gold in the world, cloak your
conscience nor mine to make her ruler of a house which is of so
ungodly demeanour; nor I trust you would not that neither for brother
nor sister I should so distain mine honour or conscience." He
objected, on similar grounds, to the prioress whom Wolsey wished to
nominate; the Cardinal neglected Henry's wishes, and thereby called
down upon himself a rebuke remarkable for dignity and delicacy. "The
great affection and love I bear you," wrote the King, "causeth me,
using the doctrine of my Master, saying <i>Quem diligo, castigo</i>, thus
plainly, as ensueth, to break to you my mind.... Methink it is not the
right train of a trusty loving friend and servant, when the matter is
put by the master's consent into his arbitre and judgment (specially
in a matter wherein his master hath both royalty and interest), to
elect and choose a person which was by him defended (forbidden). And
yet another thing, which much displeaseth me more,&mdash;that is, to cloak
your offence made by ignorance of my pleasure, saying that you
expressly knew not my determinate mind in that behalf." Then, after
showing how empty were Wolsey's excuses, he continues: "Ah! my Lord,
it is a double offence, both to do ill and colour it too;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>(p. 243)</span>
but with men that have wit it cannot be accepted so. Wherefore, good
my Lord, use no more that way with me, for there is no man living that
more hateth it." He then proceeds to warn the Cardinal against
sinister reports with regard to his methods of raising money for his
college at Oxford. "They say the college is a cloak for all mischief.
I perceive by your letter that you have received money of the exempts
for having their old visitors. If your legacy (legatine authority) is
a cloak <i>apud homines</i>, it is not <i>apud Deum</i>. I doubt not, therefore,
you will desist." Wolsey had used his legatine authority to extort
money from monasteries as the price of their immunity from his
visitatorial powers. The monasteries, too, had strenuously opposed the
late Amicable Loan to the King; by Wolsey's means they had been
released from that obligation; and Henry strongly suspected that they
had purchased their exemption from relieving his necessities by lavish
contributions to the Cardinal's colleges. "I pray you, my Lord," he
concludes, "think not that it is upon any displeasure that I write
this unto you. For surely it is for my discharge afore God, being in
the room that I am in; and secondly for the great zeal I bear unto
you." Henry possessed in the highest degree not a few of the best of
kingly attributes. His words are not the words of a hypocrite without
conscience, devoid of the fear of God and man. For all the strange and
violent things that he did, he obtained the sanction of his
conscience, but his imperious egotism made conscience his humble
slave, and blinded to his own sins a judgment so keen to detect and
chastise the failings of others.</p>

<p>These incidents, of more than a year before the Cardinal's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>(p. 244)</span>
fall, illustrate the change in the respective positions of monarch and
minister. There was no doubt now which was the master; there was no
king but one. Henry was already taking, as Du Bellay said, "the
management of
everything".<a id="footnotetag687" name="footnotetag687"></a><a href="#footnote687">[687]</a>
Wolsey himself knew that he had lost
the King's confidence. He began to talk of retirement. He told Du
Bellay, in or before August, 1528, that when he had established a firm
amity between France and England, extinguished the hatred between the
two nations, reformed the laws and customs of England, and settled the
succession, he would retire and serve God to the end of his
days.<a id="footnotetag688" name="footnotetag688"></a><a href="#footnote688">[688]</a>
The Frenchman thought this was merely to represent as voluntary a loss
of power which he saw would soon be inevitable; but the conversation
is a striking illustration of the difference between Henry and Wolsey,
and helps to explain why Wolsey accomplished so little that lasted,
while Henry accomplished so much. The Cardinal seems to have been
entirely devoid of that keen perception of the distinction between
what was, and what was not, practicable, which was Henry's saving
characteristic. In the evening of his days, after sixteen years of
almost unlimited power, he was speaking of plans, which might have
taxed the energies of a life-time, as preliminaries to a speedy
withdrawal from the cares of State. He had enjoyed an unequalled
opportunity of effecting these reforms, but what were the results of
his administration? The real greatness and splendour of Henry's reign
are said to have departed with Wolsey's
fall.<a id="footnotetag689" name="footnotetag689"></a><a href="#footnote689">[689]</a>
The gilt and the
tinsel were indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>(p. 245)</span>
stripped off, but the permanent results
of Henry's reign were due to its later course. Had he died when Wolsey
fell, what would have been his place in history? A brilliant figure,
no doubt, who might have been thought capable of much, had he not
failed to achieve anything. He had made wars from which England
derived no visible profit; not an acre of territory had been acquired;
the wealth, amassed by Henry VII., had been squandered, and Henry
VIII., in 1529, was reduced to searching for gold mines in
England.<a id="footnotetag690" name="footnotetag690"></a><a href="#footnote690">[690]</a>
The loss of his subjects' blood and treasure had been
followed by the loss of their affections. The exuberant loyalty of
1509 had been turned into the wintry discontent of 1527. England had
been raised to a high place in the councils of Europe by 1521, but her
fall was quite as rapid, and in 1525 she counted for less than she had
done in 1513. At home the results were equally barren; the English
hold on Ireland was said, in 1528, to be weaker than it had been since
the conquest;<a id="footnotetag691" name="footnotetag691"></a><a href="#footnote691">[691]</a>
and the English statute-book between 1509 and 1529
may be searched in vain for an act of importance, while the
statute-book between 1529 and 1547 contains a list of acts which have
never been equalled for their supreme importance in the subsequent
history of England.</p>

<p>Wolsey's policy was, indeed, a brilliant fiasco; with a pre-eminent
genius for diplomacy, he thought he could make England, by diplomacy
alone, arbiter of Europe. Its position in 1521 was artificial; it had
not the means to support a grandeur which was only built on the wealth
left
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>(p. 246)</span>
by Henry VII. and on Wolsey's skill. England owed her
advance in repute to the fact that Wolsey made her the paymaster of
Europe. "The reputation of England for wealth," said an English
diplomatist in 1522, "is a great cause of the esteem in which it is
held."<a id="footnotetag692" name="footnotetag692"></a><a href="#footnote692">[692]</a>
But, by 1523, that wealth had failed; Parliament refused
to levy more taxes, and Wolsey's pretensions collapsed like a pack of
cards. He played no part in the peace of Cambrai, which settled for
the time the conditions of Europe. When rumours of the clandestine
negotiations between France and Spain reached England, Wolsey staked
his head to the King that they were pure
invention.<a id="footnotetag693" name="footnotetag693"></a><a href="#footnote693">[693]</a>
He could not
believe that peace was possible, unless it were made by him. But the
rumours were true, and Henry exacted the penalty. The positive results
of the Cardinal's policy were nil; the chief negative result was that
he had staved off for many years the ruin of the Church, but he only
did it by plunging England in the maëlstrom of foreign intrigue and of
futile wars.</p>

<p>The end was not long delayed. "I see clearly," writes Du Bellay on 4th
October, 1529, "that by this Parliament Wolsey will completely lose
his influence; I see no chance to the
contrary."<a id="footnotetag694" name="footnotetag694"></a><a href="#footnote694">[694]</a>
Henry
anticipated the temper of Parliament. A bill of indictment was
preferred against him in the Court of King's Bench, and on the 22nd of
October he acknowledged his liability to the penalties of
<i>præmunire</i>.<a id="footnotetag695" name="footnotetag695"></a><a href="#footnote695">[695]</a>
The Great Seal was taken from him by the Dukes of
Norfolk and Suffolk. In November the House of Lords passed a bill of
attainder against him, but the Commons were persuaded by Cromwell,
acting with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>(p. 247)</span>
Henry's connivance, to throw it out. "The King,"
wrote Chapuys, "is thought to bear the Cardinal no ill-will;" and
Campeggio thought that he would "not go to extremes, but act
considerately in this matter, as he is accustomed to do in all his
actions."<a id="footnotetag696" name="footnotetag696"></a><a href="#footnote696">[696]</a>
Wolsey was allowed to retain the Archbishopric of York,
a sum in money and goods equivalent to at least £70,000, and a pension
of 1,000 marks from the See of
Winchester.<a id="footnotetag697" name="footnotetag697"></a><a href="#footnote697">[697]</a>
In the following
spring he set out to spend his last days in his northern see; six
months he devoted to his archiepiscopal duties, confirming thousands
of children, arranging disputes among neighbours, and winning such
hold on the hearts of the people as he had never known in the days of
his pride. Crowds in London had flocked to gloat over the sight of the
broken man; now crowds in Yorkshire came to implore his blessing.</p>

<p>He prepared for his installation at York on 7th November, 1530; on the
4th he was arrested for treason. His Italian physician, Agostini, had
betrayed him; he was accused of having asked Francis I. to intercede
with Henry on his behalf, which was
true;<a id="footnotetag698" name="footnotetag698"></a><a href="#footnote698">[698]</a>
and he seems also to
have sought the mediation of Charles V. But Agostini further declared
that Wolsey had written to Clement, urging him to excommunicate Henry
and raise an insurrection, by which the Cardinal might recover his
power.<a id="footnotetag699" name="footnotetag699"></a><a href="#footnote699">[699]</a> By
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>(p. 248)</span>
Pontefract, Doncaster, Nottingham, with
feeble steps and slow, the once-proud prelate, broken in spirit and
shattered in health, returned to meet his doom. His gaol was to be the
cell in the Tower, which had served for the Duke of
Buckingham.<a id="footnotetag700" name="footnotetag700"></a><a href="#footnote700">[700]</a>
But a kindlier fate than a traitor's death was in store. "I am come,"
he said to the monks of Leicester Abbey, "I am come to leave my bones
among you." He died there at eight o'clock on St. Andrew's morning,
and there, on the following day, he was simply and quietly buried.
"If," he exclaimed in his last hour, "I had served God as diligently
as I have done the King, He would not have given me over in my grey
hairs." That cry, wrung from Wolsey, echoed throughout the Tudor
times.<a id="footnotetag701" name="footnotetag701"></a><a href="#footnote701">[701]</a>
Men paid <i>le nouveau Messie</i> a devotion they owed to the
old; they rendered unto Cæsar the things that were God's. They reaped
their reward in riches and pomp and power, but they won no peace of
mind. The favour of princes is fickle, and "the wrath of the King is
death". So thought Wolsey and Warham and Norfolk. "Is that all?" said
More, with prophetic soul, to Norfolk; "then in good faith between
your grace and me is but this, that I shall die to-day and you shall
die to-morrow."<a id="footnotetag702" name="footnotetag702"></a><a href="#footnote702">[702]</a></p>





<h3>CHAPTER X.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>(p. 249)</span></h3>

<h4>THE KING AND HIS PARLIAMENT.</h4>


<p>In the closing days of July, 1529, a courier came posting from Rome
with despatches announcing the alliance of Clement and Charles, and
the revocation to the Papal Court of the suit between Henry VIII. and
the Emperor's aunt. Henry replied with no idle threats or empty
reproaches, but his retort was none the less effective. On the 9th of
August<a id="footnotetag703" name="footnotetag703"></a><a href="#footnote703">[703]</a>
writs were issued from Chancery summoning that Parliament
which met on the 3rd of November and did not separate till the last
link in the chain which bound England to Rome was sundered, and the
country was fairly launched on that sixty years' struggle which the
defeat of the Spanish Armada
concluded.<a id="footnotetag704" name="footnotetag704"></a><a href="#footnote704">[704]</a>
The step might well seem
a desperate hazard. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>(p. 250)</span>
last Parliament had broken up in
discontent; it had been followed by open revolt in various shires;
while from others there had since then come demands for the repayment
of the loan, which Henry was in no position to grant. Francis and
Charles, on whose mutual enmity England's safety largely depended, had
made their peace at Cambrai; and the Emperor was free to foment
disaffection in Ireland and to instigate Scotland to war. His
chancellor was boasting that the imperialists could, if they would,
drive Henry from his kingdom within three
months,<a id="footnotetag705" name="footnotetag705"></a><a href="#footnote705">[705]</a>
and he based
his hopes on revolt among Henry's own subjects. The divorce had been
from the beginning, and remained to the end, a stumbling-block to the
people. Catherine received ovations wherever she went, while the
utmost efforts of the King could scarcely protect Anne Boleyn from
popular insult. The people were moved, not only by a creditable
feeling that Henry's first wife was an injured woman, but by the fear
lest a breach with Charles should destroy their trade in wool, on
which, said the imperial ambassador, half the realm depended for
sustenance.<a id="footnotetag706" name="footnotetag706"></a><a href="#footnote706">[706]</a></p>

<p>To summon a Parliament at such a conjuncture seemed to be courting
certain ruin. In reality, it was the first and most striking instance
of the audacity and insight which were to enable Henry to guide the
whirlwind and direct the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>(p. 251)</span>
storm of the last eighteen years of
his reign. Clement had put in his hands the weapon with which he
secured his divorce and broke the bonds of Rome. "If," wrote Wolsey a
day or two before the news of the revocation arrived, "the King be
cited to appear at Rome in person or by proxy, and his prerogative be
interfered with, none of his subjects will tolerate it. If he appears
in Italy, it will be at the head of a formidable
army."<a id="footnotetag707" name="footnotetag707"></a><a href="#footnote707">[707]</a> A
sympathiser with Catherine expressed his resentment at his King being
summoned to plead as a party in his own realm before the legatine
Court;<a id="footnotetag708" name="footnotetag708"></a><a href="#footnote708">[708]</a>
and it has even been suggested that those proceedings were
designed to irritate popular feeling against the Roman jurisdiction.
Far more offensive was it to national prejudice, that England's king
should be cited to appear before a court in a distant land, dominated
by the arms of a foreign prince. Nothing did more to alienate men's
minds from the Papacy. Henry would never have been able to obtain his
divorce on its merits as they appeared to his people. But now the
divorce became closely interwoven with another and a wider question,
the papal jurisdiction in England; and on that question Henry carried
with him the good wishes of the vast bulk of the laity. There were few
Englishmen who would not resent the petition presented to the Pope in
1529 by Charles V. and Ferdinand that the English Parliament should be
forbidden to discuss the question of
divorce.<a id="footnotetag709" name="footnotetag709"></a><a href="#footnote709">[709]</a>
By summoning
Parliament, Henry opened the floodgates of anti-papal and
anti-sacerdotal feelings which Wolsey had long kept shut; and the
unpopular divorce
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>(p. 252)</span>
became merely a cross-current in the main
stream which flowed in Henry's favour.</p>

<p>It was thus with some confidence that Henry appealed from the Pope to
his people. He could do so all the more surely, if, as is alleged,
there was no freedom of election, and if the House of Commons was
packed with royal
nominees.<a id="footnotetag710" name="footnotetag710"></a><a href="#footnote710">[710]</a>
But these assertions may be dismissed
as gross exaggerations. The election of county members was marked by
unmistakable signs of genuine popular liberty. There was often a riot,
and sometimes a secret canvass among freeholders to promote or defeat
a particular
candidate.<a id="footnotetag711" name="footnotetag711"></a><a href="#footnote711">[711]</a>
In 1547 the council ventured to recommend
a minister to the freeholders of Kent. The electors objected; the
council reprimanded the sheriff for representing its recommendation as
a command; it protested that it never dreamt of depriving the shire of
its "liberty of election," but "would take it thankfully" if the
electors would give their voices to the ministerial candidate. The
electors were not to be soothed by soft words, and that Government
candidate had to find another
seat.<a id="footnotetag712" name="footnotetag712"></a><a href="#footnote712">[712]</a>
In the boroughs there was
every variety of franchise. In some it was almost democratic; in
others elections were in the hands of one or two voters. In the city
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>(p. 253)</span>
of London the election for the Parliament of 1529 was held on
5th October, <i>immensa communitate tunc presente</i>, in the Guildhall;
there is no hint of royal interference, the election being conducted
in the customary way, namely, two candidates were nominated by the
mayor and aldermen, and two by the
citizens.<a id="footnotetag713" name="footnotetag713"></a><a href="#footnote713">[713]</a>
The general tendency
had for more than a century, however, been towards close corporations
in whose hands the parliamentary franchise was generally vested, and
consequently towards restricting the basis of popular representation.
The narrower that basis became, the greater the facilities it afforded
for external influence. In many boroughs elections were largely
determined by recommendations from neighbouring magnates, territorial
or official.<a id="footnotetag714" name="footnotetag714"></a><a href="#footnote714">[714]</a>
At Gatton the lords of the manor nominated the
members for Parliament, and the formal election was merely a matter of
drawing up an indenture between Sir Roger Copley and the
sheriff,<a id="footnotetag715" name="footnotetag715"></a><a href="#footnote715">[715]</a>
and the Bishop of Winchester was wont to select representatives for
more than one borough within the bounds of his
diocese.<a id="footnotetag716" name="footnotetag716"></a><a href="#footnote716">[716]</a>
The Duke
of Norfolk claimed to be able to return ten members in Sussex and
Surrey alone.<a id="footnotetag717" name="footnotetag717"></a><a href="#footnote717">[717]</a></p>

<p>But these nominations were not royal, and there is no reason
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>(p. 254)</span>
to suppose that the nominees were any more likely to be subservient to
the Crown than freely elected members unless the local magnate
happened to be a royal minister. Their views depended on those of
their patrons, who might be opposed to the Court; and, in 1539,
Cromwell's agents were considering the advisability of setting up
Crown candidates against those of Gardiner, Bishop of
Winchester.<a id="footnotetag718" name="footnotetag718"></a><a href="#footnote718">[718]</a>
The curious letter to Cromwell in
1529,<a id="footnotetag719" name="footnotetag719"></a><a href="#footnote719">[719]</a>
upon which is based the
theory that the House of Commons consisted of royal nominees, is
singularly inconclusive. Cromwell sought Henry's permission to serve
in Parliament for two reasons; firstly, he was still a servant of the
obnoxious and fallen Cardinal; secondly, he was seeking to transfer
himself to Henry's service, and thought he might be useful to the King
in the House of Commons. If Henry accepted his offer, Cromwell was to
be nominated for Oxford; if he were not elected there, he was to be
put up for one of the boroughs in the diocese of Winchester, then
vacant through Wolsey's resignation. Even with the King's assent, his
election at Oxford was not regarded as certain; and, as a matter of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>(p. 255)</span>
fact, Cromwell sat neither for Oxford, nor for any
constituency in the diocese of Winchester, but for the borough of
Taunton.<a id="footnotetag720" name="footnotetag720"></a><a href="#footnote720">[720]</a>
Crown influence could only make itself effectively felt
in the limited number of royal boroughs; and the attempts to increase
that influence by the creation of constituencies susceptible to royal
influence were all subsequent in date to 1529. The returns of members
of Parliament are not extant from 1477 to 1529, but a comparison of
the respective number of constituencies in those two years reveals
only six in 1529 which had not sent members to a previous Parliament;
and almost if not all of these six owed their representation to their
increasing population and importance, and not to any desire to pack
the House of Commons. Indeed, as a method of enforcing the royal will
upon Parliament, the creation of half a dozen boroughs was both futile
and unnecessary. So small a number of votes was useless, except in the
case of a close division of well-drilled parties, of which there is no
trace in the Parliaments of Henry
VIII.<a id="footnotetag721" name="footnotetag721"></a><a href="#footnote721">[721]</a>
The House of Commons
acted as a whole, and not in two sections. "The sense of the House"
was more apparent in its decisions then than it is to-day. Actual
divisions were rare; either a proposal commended itself to the House,
or it did not; and in both cases the question was usually determined
without a vote.</p>

<p>The creation of boroughs was also unnecessary. Parliaments packed
themselves quite well enough to suit Henry's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>(p. 256)</span>
purpose,
without any interference on his part. The limiting of the county
franchise to forty-shilling (<i>i.e.</i>, thirty pounds in modern currency)
freeholders, and the dying away of democratic feeling in the towns,
left parliamentary representation mainly in the hands of the landed
gentry and of the prosperous commercial classes; and from them the
Tudors derived their most effective support. There was discontent in
abundance during Tudor times, but it was social and economic, and not
as a rule political. It was directed against the enclosers of common
lands; against the agricultural capitalists, who bought up farms,
evicted the tenants, and converted their holdings to pasture; against
the large traders in towns who monopolised commerce at the expense of
their poorer competitors. It was concerned, not with the one tyrant on
the throne, but with the thousand petty tyrants of the villages and
towns, against whom the poorer commons looked to their King for
protection. Of this discontent Parliament could not be the focus, for
members of Parliament were themselves the offenders. "It is hard,"
wrote a contemporary radical, "to have these ills redressed by
Parliament, because it pricketh them chiefly which be chosen to be
burgesses.... Would to God they would leave their old accustomed
choosing of burgesses! For whom do they choose but such as be rich or
bear some office in the country, many times such as be boasters and
braggers? Such have they ever hitherto chosen; be he never so very a
fool, drunkard, extortioner, adulterer, never so covetous and crafty a
person, yet, if he be rich, bear any office, if he be a jolly cracker
and bragger in the country, he must be a burgess of Parliament. Alas,
how can any such study, or give any godly counsel for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>(p. 257)</span>
commonwealth?"<a id="footnotetag722" name="footnotetag722"></a><a href="#footnote722">[722]</a>
This passage gives no support to the theory that
members of Parliament were nothing but royal nominees. If the
constituencies themselves were bent on electing "such as bare office
in the country," there was no call for the King's intervention; and
the rich merchants and others, of whom complaint is made, were almost
as much to the royal taste as were the officials themselves.</p>

<p>For the time being, in fact, the interests of the King and of the lay
middle classes coincided, both in secular and ecclesiastical affairs.
Commercial classes are generally averse from war, at least from war
waged within their own borders, from which they can extract no profit.
They had every inducement to support Henry's Government against the
only alternative, anarchy. In ecclesiastical politics they, as well as
the King, had their grievances against the Church. Both thought the
clergy too rich, and that ecclesiastical revenues could be put to
better uses in secular hands. Community of interests produced harmony
of action; and a century and a half was to pass before Parliament
again met so often, or sat so long, as it did during the latter half
of Henry's reign. From 1509 to 1515 there had been on an average a
parliamentary session once a
year,<a id="footnotetag723" name="footnotetag723"></a><a href="#footnote723">[723]</a>
and in February, 1512, Warham,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>(p. 258)</span>
as Lord Chancellor, had in opening the session discoursed on
the necessity of frequent
Parliaments.<a id="footnotetag724" name="footnotetag724"></a><a href="#footnote724">[724]</a>
Then there supervened the
ecclesiastical despotism of Wolsey, who tried, like Charles I., to
rule without Parliament, and with the same fatal result to himself;
but, from Wolsey's fall till Henry's death, there was seldom a year
without a parliamentary session. Tyrants have often gone about to
break Parliaments, and in the end Parliaments have generally broken
them. Henry was not of the number; he never went about to break
Parliament. He found it far too useful, and he used it. He would have
been as reluctant to break Parliament as Ulysses the bow which he
alone could bend.</p>

<p>No monarch, in fact, was ever a more zealous champion of parliamentary
privileges, a more scrupulous observer of parliamentary forms, or a
more original pioneer of sound constitutional doctrine. In 1543 he
first enunciated the constitutional principle that sovereignty is
vested in the "King in Parliament". "We," he declared to the Commons,
"at no time stand so highly in our estate royal as in the time of
Parliament, wherein we as head and you as members are conjoined and
knit together in one body politic, so as whatsoever offence or injury
during that time is offered to the meanest member of the House, is to
be judged as done against our person and the whole Court of
Parliament."<a id="footnotetag725" name="footnotetag725"></a><a href="#footnote725">[725]</a>
He was careful to observe himself the deference to
parliamentary privilege which he exacted from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>(p. 259)</span>
others. It is
no strange aberration from the general tenor of his rule that in 1512
by Strode's
case<a id="footnotetag726" name="footnotetag726"></a><a href="#footnote726">[726]</a>
the freedom of speech of members of Parliament
was established, and their freedom from arrest by Ferrers' case in
1543. In 1515 Convocation had enviously petitioned for the same
liberty of speech as was enjoyed in Parliament, where members might
even attack the law of the land and not be called in question
therefor.<a id="footnotetag727" name="footnotetag727"></a><a href="#footnote727">[727]</a>
"I am," writes Bishop Gardiner, in 1547, apologising
for the length of a letter, "like one of the Commons' house, that,
when I am in my tale, think I should have liberty to make an
end;"<a id="footnotetag728" name="footnotetag728"></a><a href="#footnote728">[728]</a>
and again he refers to a speech he made during Henry's
reign "in the Parliament house, <i>where was free speech without
danger</i>".<a id="footnotetag729" name="footnotetag729"></a><a href="#footnote729">[729]</a>
Wolsey had raised a storm in 1523 by trying to browbeat
the House of Commons. Henry never erred in that respect. In 1532 a
member moved that Henry should take back Catherine to
wife.<a id="footnotetag730" name="footnotetag730"></a><a href="#footnote730">[730]</a>
Nothing could have touched the King on a tenderer spot. Charles I.,
for a less offence, would have gone to the House to arrest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>(p. 260)</span>
the offender. All Henry did was to argue the point of his marriage
with the Speaker and a deputation from the Commons; no proceedings
whatever were taken against the member himself. In 1529 John Petit,
one of the members for London, opposed the bill releasing Henry from
his obligation to repay the loan; the only result apparently was to
increase Petit's repute in the eyes of the King, who "would ask in
Parliament time if Petit were on his
side".<a id="footnotetag731" name="footnotetag731"></a><a href="#footnote731">[731]</a>
There is, in fact,
nothing to show that Henry VIII. intimidated his Commons at any time,
or that he packed the Parliament of 1529. Systematic interference in
elections was a later expedient devised by Thomas Cromwell. It was
apparently tried during the bye-elections of 1534, and at the general
elections of 1536<a id="footnotetag732" name="footnotetag732"></a><a href="#footnote732">[732]</a>
and 1539. Cromwell then endeavoured to secure
a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>(p. 261)</span>
majority in favour of himself and his own particular
policy against the reactionary party in the council. His schemes had
created a division among the laity, and rendered necessary recourse to
political methods of which there was no need, so long as the laity
remained united against the Church. Nor is it without significance
that its adoption was shortly followed by Cromwell's fall. Henry did
not approve of ministers who sought to make a party for themselves.
The packing of Parliaments has in fact been generally the death-bed
expedient of a moribund Government. The Stuarts had their
"Undertakers," and the only Parliament of Tudor times which consisted
mainly of Government nominees was that gathered by Northumberland on
the eve of his fall in March, 1553; and that that body was
exceptionally constituted is obvious from Renard's inquiry in August,
1553, as to whether Charles V. would advise his cousin, Queen Mary, to
summon a general Parliament or merely an assembly of "notables" after
the manner introduced by Northumberland.</p>

<p>But, while Parliament was neither packed nor terrorised to any great
extent, the harmony which prevailed between it and the King has
naturally led to the charge of servility. Insomuch as it was servile
at all, Parliament faithfully represented its constituents; but the
mere coincidence between the wishes of Henry and those of Parliament
is no proof of
servility.<a id="footnotetag733" name="footnotetag733"></a><a href="#footnote733">[733]</a>
That accusation can
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>(p. 262)</span>
only be
substantiated by showing that Parliament did, not what it wanted, but
what it did not want, out of deference to Henry. And that has never
been proved. It has never been shown that the nation resented the
statutes giving Henry's proclamations the force of laws, enabling him
to settle the succession by will, or any of the other acts usually
adduced to prove the subservience of Parliament. When Henry was dead,
Protector Somerset secured the repeal of most of these laws, but he
lost his head for his pains. There is, indeed, no escape from the
conclusion that the English people then approved of a dictatorship,
and that Parliament was acting deliberately and voluntarily when it
made Henry dictator. It made him dictator because it felt that he
would do what it wanted, and better with, than without, extraordinary
powers. The fact that Parliament rejected some of Henry's measures is
strong presumption that it could have rejected more, had it been so
minded. No projects were more dear to Henry's heart than the statutes
of Wills and of Uses, yet both were rejected twice at least in the
Parliament of
1529-36.<a id="footnotetag734" name="footnotetag734"></a><a href="#footnote734">[734]</a></p>

<p>The general harmony between King and Parliament was based on a
fundamental similarity of interests; the harmony in detail was worked
out, not by the forcible exertion of Henry's will, but by his careful
and skilful manipulation of both Houses. No one was ever a greater
adept in the management of the House of Commons,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>(p. 263)</span>
which is
easy to humour but hard to drive. Parliaments are jealous bodies, but
they are generally pleased with attentions; and Henry VIII. was very
assiduous in the attentions he paid to his lay Lords and Commons. From
1529 he suffered no intermediary to come between Parliament and
himself. Cromwell was more and more employed by the
King,<a id="footnotetag735" name="footnotetag735"></a><a href="#footnote735">[735]</a> but
only in subordinate matters, and when important questions were at
issue Henry managed the business himself. He constantly visited both
Houses and remained within their precincts for hours at a
time,<a id="footnotetag736" name="footnotetag736"></a><a href="#footnote736">[736]</a>
watching every move in the game and taking note of every symptom of
parliamentary feeling. He sent no royal commands to his faithful
Commons; in this respect he was less arbitrary than his daughter,
Queen Elizabeth. He submitted points for their consideration, argued
with them, and frankly gave his reasons. It was always done, of
course, with a magnificent air of royal condescension, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>(p. 264)</span>
with such grace as to carry the conviction that he was really pleased
to condescend and to take counsel with his subjects, and that he did
so because he trusted his Parliament, and expected his Parliament to
place an equal confidence in him. Henry VIII. acted more as the leader
of both Houses than as a King; and, like modern parliamentary leaders,
he demanded the bulk of their time for measures which he himself
proposed.</p>

<p>The fact that the legislation of Henry's reign was initiated almost
entirely by Government is not, however, a conclusive proof of the
servility of Parliament. For, though it may have been the theory that
Parliament existed to pass laws of its own conception, such has never
been the practice, except when there has been chronic opposition
between the executive and the legislature. Parliament has generally
been the instrument of Government, a condition essential to strong and
successful administration; and it is still summoned mainly to discuss
such measures as the executive thinks fit to lay before it. Certainly
the proportion of Government bills to other measures passed in Henry's
reign was less than it is to-day. A private member's bill then stood
more chance of becoming law, and a Government bill ran greater risks
of being rejected. That, of course, is not the whole truth. One of the
reasons why Henry's House of Commons felt at liberty to reject bills
proposed by the King, was that such rejection did not involve the fall
of a Government which on other grounds the House wished to support. It
did not even entail a dissolution. Not that general elections
possessed any terrors for sixteenth-century Parliaments. A seat in the
House of Commons was not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>(p. 265)</span>
considered a very great prize. The
classes, from which its members were drawn, were much more bent on the
pursuit of their own private fortunes than on participation in public
affairs. Their membership was not seldom a
burden,<a id="footnotetag737" name="footnotetag737"></a><a href="#footnote737">[737]</a>
and the long
sessions of the Reformation Parliament constituted an especial
grievance. One member complained that those sessions cost him
equivalent to about five hundred pounds over and above the wages paid
him by his
constituents.<a id="footnotetag738" name="footnotetag738"></a><a href="#footnote738">[738]</a>
Leave to go home was often requested,
and the imperial ambassador records that Henry, with characteristic
craft, granted such licences to hostile members, but refused them to
his own
supporters.<a id="footnotetag739" name="footnotetag739"></a><a href="#footnote739">[739]</a>
That was a legitimate parliamentary
stratagem. It was not Henry's fault if members preferred their private
concerns to the interests of Catherine of Aragon or to the liberties
of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Henry's greatest advantage lay, however, in a circumstance which
constitutes the chief real difference between the Parliaments of the
sixteenth century and those of to-day. His members of Parliament were
representatives rather than delegates. They were elected as fit and
proper persons to decide upon such questions as should be submitted to
them in the Parliament House, and not merely as fit and proper persons
to register decisions already reached by their constituents. Although
they were in the habit of rendering to their constituents an account
of their proceedings at the close of each
session,<a id="footnotetag740" name="footnotetag740"></a><a href="#footnote740">[740]</a>
and although
the fact that they depended upon their constituencies for their wages
prevented their acting in opposition
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>(p. 266)</span>
to their constituents'
wishes, they received no precise instructions. They went to Parliament
unfettered by definite pledges. They were thus more susceptible, not
only to pressure, but also to argument; and it is possible that in
those days votes were sometimes affected by speeches. The action of
members was determined, not by previous engagements or party
discipline, but by their view of the merits and necessities of the
case before them. Into that view extraneous circumstances, such as
fear of the King, might to a certain extent intrude; but such evidence
as is available points decisively to the conclusion that co-operation
between the King and Parliament was secured, partly by Parliament
doing what Henry wanted, and partly by Henry doing what Parliament
wanted. Parliament did not always do as the King desired, nor did the
King's actions always commend themselves to Parliament. Most of the
measures of the Reformation Parliament were matters of give and take.
It was due to Henry's skill, and to the circumstances of the time that
the King's taking was always to his own profit, and his giving at the
expense of the clergy. He secured the support of the Commons for his
own particular ends by promising the redress of their grievances
against the bishops and priests. It is said that he instituted the
famous petitions urged against the clergy in 1532, and it is hinted
that the abuses, of which those petitions complained, had no real
existence. No doubt Henry encouraged the Commons' complaints; he had
every reason to do so, but he did not invent the abuses. If the
Commons did not feel the grievances, the King's promise to redress
them would be no inducement to Parliament to comply with the royal
demands. The hostility
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>(p. 267)</span>
of the laity to the clergy, arising
out of these grievances, was in fact the lever with which Henry
overthrew the papal authority, and the basis upon which he built his
own supremacy over the Church.</p>

<p>This anti-ecclesiastical bias on the part of the laity was the
dominant factor in the Reformation under Henry VIII. But the word in
its modern sense is scarcely applicable to the ecclesiastical policy
of that King. Its common acceptation implies a purification of
doctrine, but it is doubtful whether any idea of interfering with
dogma ever crossed the minds of the monarchs, who, for more than a
generation, had been proclaiming the need for a reformation. Their
proposal was to reform the practice of the clergy; and the method they
favoured most was the abolition of clerical privileges and the
appropriation of ecclesiastical property. The Reformation in England,
so far as it was carried by Henry VIII., was, indeed, neither more nor
less than a violent self-assertion of the laity against the immunities
which the Church had herself enjoyed, and the restraints which she
imposed upon others. It was not primarily a breach between the Church
of England and the Roman communion, a repudiation on the part of
English ecclesiastics of a harassing papal yoke; for it is fairly
obvious that under Henry VIII. the Church took no measures against
Rome that were not forced on it by the State. It was not till the
reigns of Edward VI. and Elizabeth that the Church accorded a consent,
based on conviction, to a settlement originally extorted by force. The
Reformation was rather a final assertion by the State of its authority
over the Church in England. The breach with the Roman Church, the
repudiation of papal influence in English ecclesiastical affairs, was
not a spontaneous clerical
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>(p. 268)</span>
movement; it was the effect of
the subjection of the Church to the national temporal power. The
Church in England had hitherto been a semi-independent part of the
political community. It was semi-national, semi-universal; it owed one
sort of fealty to the universal Pope, and another to the national
King. The rising spirit of nationality could brook no divided
allegiance; and the universal gave way to the national idea. There was
to be no <i>imperium in imperio</i>, but "one body
politic,"<a id="footnotetag741" name="footnotetag741"></a><a href="#footnote741">[741]</a>
with one
Supreme Head. Henry VIII. is reported by Chapuys as saying that he was
King, Emperor and Pope, all in one, so far as England was
concerned.<a id="footnotetag742" name="footnotetag742"></a><a href="#footnote742">[742]</a>
The Church was to be nationalised; it was to
compromise its universal character, and to become the Church <i>of</i>
England, rather than a branch of the Church universal <i>in</i> England.</p>

<p>The revolution was inevitably effected through the action of the State
rather than that of the Church. The Church, which, like religion
itself, is in essence universal and not national, regarded with
abhorrence the prospect of being narrowed and debased to serve
political ends. The Church in England had moreover no means and no
weapons wherewith to effect an internal reformation independent of the
Papacy; as well might the Court of King's Bench endeavour to reform
itself without the authority of King and Parliament. The whole
jurisdiction of the Church was derived in theory from the Pope; when
Wolsey wished to reform the monasteries he had to seek authority from
Leo X.; the Archbishop of Canterbury held
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269"></a>(p. 269)</span>
a court at Lambeth
and exercised juridical powers, but he did so as <i>legatus natus</i> of
the Apostolic See, and not as archbishop, and this authority could at
any time be superseded by that of a legate <i>a latere</i>, as Warham's was
by Wolsey's. It was not his own but the delegated jurisdiction of
another.<a id="footnotetag743" name="footnotetag743"></a><a href="#footnote743">[743]</a>
Bishops and archbishops were only the channels of a
jurisdiction flowing from a papal fountain. Henry charged Warham in
1532 with <i>præmunire</i> because he had consecrated the Bishop of St.
Asaph before the Bishop's temporalties had been
restored.<a id="footnotetag744" name="footnotetag744"></a><a href="#footnote744">[744]</a>
The
Archbishop in reply stated that he merely acted as commissary of the
Pope, "the act was the Pope's act," and he had no discretion of his
own. He was bound to consecrate as soon as the Bishop had been
declared such in consistory at Rome. Chapters might elect, the
Archbishop might consecrate, and the King might restore the
temporalties; but none of these things gave a bishop jurisdiction.
There were in fact two and only two sources of power and jurisdiction,
the temporal sovereign and the Pope; reformation must be effected by
the one or the other. Wolsey had ideas of a national ecclesiastical
reformation, but he could have gone no farther than the Pope, who gave
him his authority, permitted. Had the Church in England transgressed
that limit, it would have become dead in schism, and Wolsey's
jurisdiction would have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>(p. 270)</span>
<i>ipso facto</i> ceased. Hence the
fundamental impossibility of Wolsey's scheme; hence the ultimate
resort to the only alternative, a reformation by the temporal
sovereign, which Wycliffe had advocated and which the Anglicans of the
sixteenth century justified by deriving the royal supremacy from the
authority conceded by the early Fathers to the Roman Emperor&mdash;an
authority prior to the Pope's.</p>

<p>Hence, too, the agency employed was Parliament and not
Convocation.<a id="footnotetag745" name="footnotetag745"></a><a href="#footnote745">[745]</a>
The representatives of the clergy met of course as
frequently as those of the laity, but their activity was purely
defensive. They suggested no changes themselves, and endeavoured
without much success to resist the innovations forced upon them by
King and by Parliament. They had every reason to fear both Henry and
the Commons. They were conscious that the Church had lost its hold
upon the nation. Its impotence was due in part to its own corruption,
in part to the fact that thriving commercial and industrial classes,
like those which elected Tudor Parliaments, are as a rule impatient of
religious or at least sacerdotal dictation. God and Mammon, in spite
of all efforts at compromise, do not really agree. In 1529, before the
meeting of Parliament, Campeggio had appealed to Henry to prevent the
ruin of the Church; he felt that without State protection the Church
could hardly stand. In 1531 Warham, the successor of Becket and
Langton, excused his compliance with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>(p. 271)</span>
Henry's demands by
pleading <i>Ira principis mors
est</i>.<a id="footnotetag746" name="footnotetag746"></a><a href="#footnote746">[746]</a>
In the draft of a speech he
drew up just before his
death,<a id="footnotetag747" name="footnotetag747"></a><a href="#footnote747">[747]</a>
the Archbishop referred to the
case of St. Thomas, hinted that Henry VIII. was going the way of Henry
II., and compared his policy with the constitutions of Clarendon. The
comparison was extraordinarily apt; Henry VIII. was doing what Henry
II. had failed to do, and the fate that attended the Angevin king
might have befallen the Tudor had Warham been Becket and the Church of
the sixteenth been the same as the Church of the twelfth century. But
they were not, and Warham appealed in vain to the liberties of the
Church granted by Magna Carta, and to the "ill end" of "several kings
who violated them". Laymen, he complained, now "advanced" their own
laws rather than those of the Church. The people, admitted so staunch
a churchman as Pole, were beginning to hate the
priests.<a id="footnotetag748" name="footnotetag748"></a><a href="#footnote748">[748]</a>
"There
were," wrote Norfolk, "infinite clamours of the temporalty here in
Parliament against the misuse of the spiritual jurisdiction.... This
realm did never grudge the tenth part against the abuses of the Church
at no Parliament in my days, as they do
now."<a id="footnotetag749" name="footnotetag749"></a><a href="#footnote749">[749]</a></p>

<p>These
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>(p. 272)</span>
infinite clamours and grudging were not the result of
the conscientious rejection of any Catholic or papal doctrine.
Englishmen are singularly free from the bondage of abstract ideas, and
they began their Reformation not with the enunciation of some new
truth, but with an attack on clerical fees. Reform was stimulated by a
practical grievance, closely connected with money, and not by a sense
of wrong done to the conscience. No dogma plays such a part in the
English Reformation as Justification by Faith did in Germany, or
Predestination in Switzerland. Parliament in 1530 had not been
appreciably affected by Tyndale's translation of the Bible or by any
of Luther's works. Tyndale was still an exile in the Netherlands,
pleading in vain for the same toleration in England as Charles V.
permitted across the sea. Frith was in the Tower&mdash;a man, wrote the
lieutenant, Walsingham, whom it would be a great pity to lose, if only
he could be reconciled<a id="footnotetag750" name="footnotetag750"></a><a href="#footnote750">[750]</a>&mdash;and
Bilney was martyred in 1531. A
parliamentary inquiry was threatened in the latter case, not because
Parliament sympathised with Bilney's doctrine, but because it was said
that the clergy had procured his burning before obtaining the State's
consent.<a id="footnotetag751" name="footnotetag751"></a><a href="#footnote751">[751]</a>
Parliament was as zealous as Convocation against heresy,
but wanted the punishment of heretics left in secular hands.</p>

<p>In this, as in other respects, the King and his Parliament were in the
fullest agreement. Henry had already given proof of his anti-clerical
bias by substituting laymen for churchmen in those great offices of
State which churchmen had usually held. From time immemorial the Lord
Chancellor had been a
Bishop,<a id="footnotetag752" name="footnotetag752"></a><a href="#footnote752">[752]</a>
but in 1529 Wolsey was succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span>
by More, and, later on, More by Audley. Similarly, the privy
seal had been held in Henry's reign by three bishops successively,
Fox, Ruthal and Tunstall: now it was entrusted to the hands of Anne
Boleyn's father, the Earl of Wiltshire. Gardiner remained secretary
for the time, but Du Bellay thought his power would have increased had
he abandoned his clerical
vows,<a id="footnotetag753" name="footnotetag753"></a><a href="#footnote753">[753]</a>
and he, too, was soon superseded
by Cromwell. Even the clerkship of Parliament was now given up to a
layman. During the first half of Henry's reign clerical influence had
been supreme in Henry's councils; during the second it was almost
entirely excluded. Like his Parliament, he was now impugning the
jurisdiction of the clergy in the matter of heresy; they were doctors,
he said, of the soul, and had nothing to do with the
body.<a id="footnotetag754" name="footnotetag754"></a><a href="#footnote754">[754]</a>
He was
even inclining to the very modern theory that marriage is a civil
contract, and that matrimonial suits should therefore be removed from
clerical
cognisance.<a id="footnotetag755" name="footnotetag755"></a><a href="#footnote755">[755]</a>
As early as 1529 he ordered Wolsey to
release the Prior of Reading, who had been imprisoned for Lutheranism,
"unless the matter is very
heinous".<a id="footnotetag756" name="footnotetag756"></a><a href="#footnote756">[756]</a>
In 1530 he was praising
Latimer's
sermons;<a id="footnotetag757" name="footnotetag757"></a><a href="#footnote757">[757]</a>
and in the same year the Bishop of Norwich
complained of a general report in his diocese that Henry favoured
heretical
books.<a id="footnotetag758" name="footnotetag758"></a><a href="#footnote758">[758]</a>
"They say that, wherever they go, they hear that
the King's pleasure
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>(p. 274)</span>
is that the New Testament in English
shall go forth." There seems little reason to doubt Hall's statement
that Henry now commanded the bishops, who, however, did nothing, to
prepare an English translation of the Bible to counteract the errors
of Tyndale's
version.<a id="footnotetag759" name="footnotetag759"></a><a href="#footnote759">[759]</a>
He wrote to the German princes extolling
their efforts towards the reformation of the
Church;<a id="footnotetag760" name="footnotetag760"></a><a href="#footnote760">[760]</a>
and many
advisers were urging him to begin a similar movement in England. Anne
Boleyn and her father were, said Chapuys, more Lutheran than Luther
himself; they were the true apostles of the new sect in
England.<a id="footnotetag761" name="footnotetag761"></a><a href="#footnote761">[761]</a></p>

<p>But, however Lutheran Anne Boleyn may have been, Henry was still true
to the orthodox faith. If he dallied with German princes, and held out
hopes to his heretic subjects, it was not because he believed in the
doctrines of either, but because both might be made to serve his own
ends. He rescued Crome from the flames, not because he doubted or
favoured Crome's heresy, but because Crome appealed from the Church to
the King, and denied the papal supremacy; that, said Henry, is not
heresy, but
truth.<a id="footnotetag762" name="footnotetag762"></a><a href="#footnote762">[762]</a>
When he sent to Oxford for the articles on
which Wycliffe had been
condemned,<a id="footnotetag763" name="footnotetag763"></a><a href="#footnote763">[763]</a>
it was not to study the great
Reformer's doctrine of the mass, but to discover Wycliffe's reasons
for calling upon the State to purify a corrupt Church, and to digest
his arguments against the temporal wealth of the clergy. When he
lauded the reforms effected by the German princes he was thinking of
their secularisation of ecclesiastical revenues.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>(p. 275)</span>
The
spoliation of the Church was consistent with the most fervent devotion
to its tenets. In 1531 Henry warned the Pope that the Emperor would
probably allow the laity "to appropriate the possessions of the
Church, which is a matter which does not touch the foundations of the
faith; and what an example this will afford to others, it is easy to
see".<a id="footnotetag764" name="footnotetag764"></a><a href="#footnote764">[764]</a>
Henry managed to improve upon Charles's example in this
respect. "He meant," he told Chapuys in 1533, "to repair the errors of
Henry II. and John, who, being in difficulties, had made England and
Ireland tributary to the Pope; he was determined also to reunite to
the Crown the goods which churchmen held of it, which his predecessors
could not alienate to his prejudice; and he was bound to do this by
the oath he had taken at his
coronation."<a id="footnotetag765" name="footnotetag765"></a><a href="#footnote765">[765]</a>
Probably it was about
this time, or a little later, that he drew up his suggestions for
altering the coronation oath, and making the royal obligations binding
only so far as the royal conscience thought fit. The German princes
had a further claim to his consideration beyond the example they set
him in dealing with the temporalties of the Church. They might be very
useful if his difference with Charles over Catherine of Aragon came to
an open breach; and the English envoys, who congratulated them on
their zeal for reform, also endeavoured to persuade them that Henry's
friendship might be no little safeguard against a despotic Emperor.</p>

<p>All these phenomena, the Reformation in Germany, heresy at home, and
the anti-sacerdotal prejudices of his subjects, were regarded by Henry
merely as circumstances which might be made subservient to his own
particular
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>(p. 276)</span>
purpose; and the skill with which he used them is
a monument of farsighted
statecraft.<a id="footnotetag766" name="footnotetag766"></a><a href="#footnote766">[766]</a>
He did not act on the
impulse of rash caprice. His passions were strong, but his
self-control was stronger; and the breach with Rome was effected with
a cold and calculated cunning, which the most adept disciple of
Machiavelli could not have excelled. He did not create the factors he
used; hostility to the Church had a real objective existence. Henry
was a great man; but the burdens his people felt were not the product
of Henry's hypnotic suggestion. He could only divert those grievances
to his own use. He had no personal dislike to probate dues or annates;
he did not pay them, but the threat of their abolition might compel
the Pope to grant his divorce. Heresy in itself was abominable, but if
heretics would maintain the royal against the papal supremacy, might
not their sins be forgiven? The strength of Henry's position lay in
the fact that he stood between two evenly balanced parties. It is
obvious that by favouring the anti-clericals he could destroy the
power of the Church. It is not so certain, but it is probable that, by
supporting the Church, he could have staved off its ruin so long as he
lived. Parliament might have been urgent, but there was no necessity
to call it together. The Reformation Parliament, which sat for seven
years, would probably have been dissolved after a few weeks had
Clement granted the divorce. It met session after session, to pass one
measure after another, each of which was designed to put fresh
pressure on the Pope. It began with the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>(p. 277)</span>
outworks of the
papal fortress; as soon as one was dismantled, Henry cried "Halt," to
see if the citadel would surrender. When it refused, the attack
recommenced. First one, then another of the Church's privileges and
the Pope's prerogatives disappeared, till there remained not one stone
upon another of the imposing edifice of ecclesiastical liberty and
papal authority in England.</p>





<h3>CHAPTER XI.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>(p. 278)</span></h3>

<h4>"DOWN WITH THE CHURCH."</h4>


<p>The Reformation Parliament met for its first session on the 3rd of
November, 1529, at the Black Friars' Hall in
London.<a id="footnotetag767" name="footnotetag767"></a><a href="#footnote767">[767]</a>
No careful
observer was in any doubt as to what its temper would be with regard
to the Church. It was opened by the King in person, and the new Lord
Chancellor, Sir Thomas More, delivered an address in which he
denounced his predecessor, Wolsey, in scathing
terms.<a id="footnotetag768" name="footnotetag768"></a><a href="#footnote768">[768]</a>
Parliament
had been summoned, he said, to reform such things as had been used or
permitted in England by inadvertence. On the following day both Houses
adjourned to Westminster on account of the plague, and the Commons
chose, as their Speaker, Sir Thomas Audley, the future Lord
Chancellor. One of their first duties was to consider a bill of
attainder against
Wolsey,<a id="footnotetag769" name="footnotetag769"></a><a href="#footnote769">[769]</a>
and the fate of that measure seems to
be destructive of one or the other of two favourite theories
respecting Henry VIII.'s Parliaments. The bill was opposed in the
Commons by Cromwell and thrown out; either it was not a mere
expression of the royal will, or Parliament was something more than
the tool of the Court. For it is hardly credible that Henry first
caused the bill to be introduced,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>(p. 279)</span>
and then ordered its
rejection. The next business was Henry's request for release from the
obligation to repay the loan which Wolsey had raised; that, too, the
Commons refused, except on
conditions.<a id="footnotetag770" name="footnotetag770"></a><a href="#footnote770">[770]</a>
But no such opposition
greeted the measures for reforming the
clergy.<a id="footnotetag771" name="footnotetag771"></a><a href="#footnote771">[771]</a>
Bills were passed
in the Commons putting a limit on the fees exacted by bishops for
probate, and for the performance of other duties then regarded as
spiritual functions. The clergy were prohibited from holding
pluralities, except in certain cases, but the act was drawn with
astonishing moderation; it did not apply to benefices acquired before
1530, unless they exceeded the number of four. Penalties against
non-residents were enacted, and an attempt was made to check the
addiction of spiritual persons to commercial pursuits.</p>

<p>These reforms seem reasonable enough, but the idea of placing a bound
to the spiritual exaction of probate seemed sacrilege to Bishop
Fisher. "My lords," he cried, "you see daily what bills come hither
from the Common
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>(p. 280)</span>
House, and all is to the destruction of the
Church. For God's sake, see what a realm the kingdom of Bohemia was;
and when the Church went down, then fell the glory of the kingdom. Now
with the Commons is nothing but 'Down with the Church!' And all this,
meseemeth, is for lack of faith
only."<a id="footnotetag772" name="footnotetag772"></a><a href="#footnote772">[772]</a>
The Commons thought a
limitation of fees an insufficient ground for a charge of heresy, and
complained of Fisher to the King through the mouth of their Speaker.
The Bishop explained away the offensive phrase, but the spiritual
peers succeeded in rejecting the Commons' bills. The way out of the
deadlock was suggested by the King; he proposed a conference between
eight members of either House. The Lords' delegates were half
spiritual, half temporal,
peers.<a id="footnotetag773" name="footnotetag773"></a><a href="#footnote773">[773]</a>
Henry knew well enough that the
Commons would vote solidly for the measures, and that the temporal
peers would support them. They did so; the bills were passed; and, on
17th December, Parliament was prorogued. We may call it a trick or
skilful parliamentary strategy; the same trick, played by the <i>Tiers
État</i> in 1789, ensured the success of the French Revolution, and it
was equally effective in England in 1529.</p>

<p>These mutterings of the storm fell on deaf ears at Rome. Clement was
deaf, not because he had not ears to hear, but because the clash of
imperial arms drowned more distant sounds. "If any one," wrote the
Bishop of Auxerre in 1531, "was ever in prison or in the power of his
enemies, the Pope is
now."<a id="footnotetag774" name="footnotetag774"></a><a href="#footnote774">[774]</a>
He was as anxious as ever to escape
responsibility. "He has told me," writes the Bishop of Tarbes to
Francis I. on the 27th of March, 1530,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>(p. 281)</span>
"more than three
times in secret that he would be glad if the marriage (with Anne
Boleyn) was already made, either by a dispensation of the English
legate or otherwise, provided it was not by his authority, or in
diminution of his power as to dispensation and limitation of Divine
law."<a id="footnotetag775" name="footnotetag775"></a><a href="#footnote775">[775]</a>
Later in the year he made his suggestion that Henry should
have two wives without prejudice to the legitimacy of the children of
either. Henry, however, would listen to neither
suggestion.<a id="footnotetag776" name="footnotetag776"></a><a href="#footnote776">[776]</a>
He
would be satisfied with nothing less than the sanction of the highest
authority recognised in England. When it became imperative that his
marriage with Anne should be legally sanctioned, and evident that no
such sanction would be forthcoming from Rome, he arranged that the
highest ecclesiastical authority recognised by law in England should
be that of the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the exigencies of the struggle drove Clement into
assertions of papal prerogative which would at any time have provoked
an outburst of national anger. On 7th March, 1530, he promulgated a
bull to be affixed to the church doors at Bruges, Tournay and Dunkirk,
inhibiting Henry, under pain of the greater excommunication, from
proceeding to that second marriage, which he was telling the Bishop of
Tarbes he wished Henry would
complete.<a id="footnotetag777" name="footnotetag777"></a><a href="#footnote777">[777]</a>
A fortnight later he
issued a second bull forbidding all ecclesiastical judges, doctors,
advocates and others to speak or write against the validity of Henry's
marriage with
Catherine.<a id="footnotetag778" name="footnotetag778"></a><a href="#footnote778">[778]</a>
If he had merely desired to prohibit
discussion of a matter under judicial consideration, he should have
imposed silence also on the advocates of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>(p. 282)</span>
the marriage, and
not left Fisher free to write books against the King and secretly send
them to Spain to be
printed.<a id="footnotetag779" name="footnotetag779"></a><a href="#footnote779">[779]</a>
On the 23rd of December following it
was decreed in Consistory at Rome that briefs should be granted
prohibiting the Archbishop of Canterbury from taking cognisance of the
suit, and forbidding Henry to cohabit with any other woman than
Catherine, and "all women in general to contract marriage with the
King of
England".<a id="footnotetag780" name="footnotetag780"></a><a href="#footnote780">[780]</a>
On the 5th of January, 1531, the Pope inhibited
laity as well as clergy, universities, parliaments and courts of law
from coming to any decision in the
case.<a id="footnotetag781" name="footnotetag781"></a><a href="#footnote781">[781]</a></p>

<p>To these fulminations the ancient laws of England provided Henry with
sufficient means of reply. "Let not the Pope suppose," wrote Henry to
Clement, "that either the King or his nobles will allow the fixed laws
of his kingdom to be set
aside."<a id="footnotetag782" name="footnotetag782"></a><a href="#footnote782">[782]</a>
A proclamation, based on the
Statutes of Provisors, was issued on 12th September, 1530, forbidding
the purchasing from the Court of Rome or the publishing of any thing
prejudicial to the realm, or to the King's intended
purposes;<a id="footnotetag783" name="footnotetag783"></a><a href="#footnote783">[783]</a> and
Norfolk was sent to remind the papal nuncio of the penalties attaching
to the importation of bulls into England without the King's consent.
But the most notorious expedient of Henry's was the appeal to the
universities of Europe, first suggested by
Cranmer.<a id="footnotetag784" name="footnotetag784"></a><a href="#footnote784">[784]</a>
Throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>(p. 283)</span>
1530 English agents were busy abroad obtaining decisions from
the universities on the question of the Pope's power to dispense with
the law against marrying a deceased brother's wife. Their success was
considerable. Paris and Orléans, Bourges and Toulouse, Bologna and
Ferrara, Pavia and Padua, all decided against the
Pope.<a id="footnotetag785" name="footnotetag785"></a><a href="#footnote785">[785]</a>
Similar
verdicts, given by Oxford and Cambridge, may be as naturally ascribed
to intimidation by Henry, as may the decisions of Spanish universities
in the Pope's favour to pressure from Charles; but the theory that all
the French and Italian universities were bribed is not very credible.
The cajolery, the threats and the bribes were not all on one side; and
in Italy at least the imperial agents would seem to have enjoyed
greater facilities than Henry's. In some individual cases there was,
no doubt, resort to improper inducements; but, if the majority in the
most famous seats of learning in Europe could be induced by filthy
lucre to vote against their conscience, it implies a greater need for
drastic reformation than the believers in the theory of corruption are
usually disposed to admit. Their decisions were, however, given on
general grounds; the question of the consummation of Catherine's
marriage with Arthur seems to have been carefully excluded. How far
that consideration would have affected the votes of the universities
can only be assumed; but it does not appear to have materially
influenced the view taken by Catherine's advocates. They allowed that
Catherine's oath would not be considered sufficient evidence in a
court of law; they admitted the necessity of proving that urgent
reasons existed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>(p. 284)</span>
for the grant of the dispensation, and the
only urgent reason they put forward was an entirely imaginary
imminence of war between Henry VII. and Ferdinand in 1503. Cardinal Du
Bellay, in 1534, asserted that no one would be so bold as to maintain
in Consistory that the dispensation ever was
valid;<a id="footnotetag786" name="footnotetag786"></a><a href="#footnote786">[786]</a>
and the
papalists were driven to the extreme contention, which was certainly
not then admitted by Catholic Europe, that, whether the marriage with
Arthur was merely a form or not, whether it was or was not against
Divine law, the Pope could, of his absolute power,
dispense.<a id="footnotetag787" name="footnotetag787"></a><a href="#footnote787">[787]</a></p>

<p>Pending the result of Henry's appeal to the universities, little was
done in the matter in England. The lords spiritual and temporal signed
in June, 1530, a letter to the Pope urging him to comply with their
King's request for a
divorce.<a id="footnotetag788" name="footnotetag788"></a><a href="#footnote788">[788]</a>
Parliament did not meet until 16th
January, 1531, and even then Chapuys reports that it was employed on
nothing more important than cross-bows and hand-guns, the act against
which was not, however, passed till 1534. The previous session had
shown that, although the Commons might demur to fiscal exactions, they
were willing enough to join Henry in any attack on the Church, and the
question was how to bring the clergy to a similar state of
acquiescence. It was naturally a more difficult task, but Henry's
ingenuity provided a sufficient inducement. His use of the statutes of
<i>præmunire</i> was very characteristic. It was conservative, it was
legal, and it was unjust. Those statutes were no innovation designed
to meet his particular case; they had been for centuries the law of
the land; and there was no denying the fact that the clergy had broken
the law
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>(p. 285)</span>
by recognising Wolsey as legate. Henry, of course,
had licensed Wolsey to act as legate, and to punish the clergy for an
offence, at which he had connived, was scarcely consistent with
justice; but no King ever showed so clearly how the soundest
constitutional maxims could be used to defeat the pleas of equity; it
was frequently laid down during his reign that no licence from the
King could be pleaded against penalties imposed by statute, and not a
few parliamentary privileges were first asserted by Henry
VIII.<a id="footnotetag789" name="footnotetag789"></a><a href="#footnote789">[789]</a>
So the clergy were cunningly caught in the meshes of the law. Chapuys
declares that no one could understand the mysteries of <i>præmunire</i>;
"its interpretation lies solely in the King's head, who amplifies it
and declares it at his pleasure, making it apply to any case he
pleases". He at least saw how <i>præmunire</i> could be made to serve his
purposes.<a id="footnotetag790" name="footnotetag790"></a><a href="#footnote790">[790]</a></p>

<p>These, at the moment, were two. He wanted to extract from the clergy a
recognition of his supremacy over the Church, and he wanted money. He
was always in need of supplies, but especially now, in case war should
arise from the Pope's refusal to grant his divorce; and Henry made it
a matter of principle that the Church should pay for wars due to the
Pope.<a id="footnotetag791" name="footnotetag791"></a><a href="#footnote791">[791]</a>
The penalty for <i>præmunire</i> was forfeiture of goods and
imprisonment, and the King probably thought he was unduly lenient in
granting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>(p. 286)</span>
a pardon for a hundred thousand pounds, when he
might have taken the whole of the clergy's goods and put them in gaol
as well. The clergy objected strongly; in the old days of the Church's
influence they would all have preferred to go to prison, and a
unanimous refusal of the King's demands would even now have baulked
his purpose. But the spirit was gone out of them. Chapuys instigated
the papal nuncio to go down to Convocation and stiffen the backs of
the
clergy.<a id="footnotetag792" name="footnotetag792"></a><a href="#footnote792">[792]</a>
They were horrified at his appearance, and besought
him to depart in haste, fearing lest this fresh constitutional breach
should be visited on their heads. Warham frightened them with the
terrors of royal displeasure; and the clerics had to content their
conscience with an Irish bull and a subterfuge. "Silence gives
consent," said the Archbishop when putting the question; "Then are we
all silent," cried the clergy. To their recognition of Henry as
Supreme Head of the Church, they added the salvo "so far as the law of
Christ allows". It was an empty phrase, thought Chapuys, for no one
would venture to dispute with the King the point where his supremacy
ended and that of Christ
began;<a id="footnotetag793" name="footnotetag793"></a><a href="#footnote793">[793]</a>
there was in fact "a new Papacy
made here".<a id="footnotetag794" name="footnotetag794"></a><a href="#footnote794">[794]</a>
The clergy repented of the concession as soon as it
was granted; they were "more conscious every day,"
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>(p. 287)</span>
wrote
Chapuys, "of the great error they committed in acknowledging the King
as sovereign of the Church"; and they made a vain, and not very
creditable, effort to get rejected by spiritual votes in the House of
Lords the measures to which they had given their assent in
Convocation.<a id="footnotetag795" name="footnotetag795"></a><a href="#footnote795">[795]</a>
The Church had surrendered with scarcely a show of
fight; henceforth Henry might feel sure that, whatever opposition he
might encounter in other quarters, the Church in England would offer
no real resistance.</p>

<p>In Parliament, notwithstanding Chapuys' remark on the triviality of
its business, more than a score of acts were passed, some limiting
such abuses as the right of sanctuary, some dealing in the familiar
way with social evils like the increase of beggars and vagabonds. The
act depriving sanctuary-men, who committed felony, of any further
protection from their sanctuary was recommended to Parliament by the
King in person. So was a curious act making poisoning
treason.<a id="footnotetag796" name="footnotetag796"></a><a href="#footnote796">[796]</a>
There had recently been an attempt to poison Fisher, which the King
brought before the House of Lords. However familiar poisoning might be
at Rome, it was a novel method in England, and was considered so
heinous a crime that the ordinary penalties for murder were thought to
be insufficient. Then the King's pardon to the clergy was embodied in
a parliamentary bill. The Commons perceived that they were not
included, took alarm, and refused to pass the bill. Henry at first
assumed a superior tone; he pointed out that the Commons could not
prevent his pardoning the clergy; he could do it as well under the
Great Seal as by statute. The Commons, however, were not satisfied.
"There was great murmuring among
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>(p. 288)</span>
them," says Chapuys, "in
the House of Commons, where it was publicly said in the presence of
some of the Privy Council that the King had burdened and oppressed his
kingdom with more imposts and exactions than any three or four of his
predecessors, and that he ought to consider that the strength of the
King lay in the affections of his people. And many instances were
alleged of the inconveniences which had happened to princes through
the ill-treatment of their
subjects."<a id="footnotetag797" name="footnotetag797"></a><a href="#footnote797">[797]</a>
Henry was too shrewd to
attempt to punish this very plain speaking. He knew that his faithful
Commons were his one support, and he yielded at once. "On learning
this," continues Chapuys, "the King granted the exemption which was
published in Parliament on Wednesday last without any reservation."
The two acts for the pardon of the spiritualty and temporalty were
passed concurrently. But, whereas the clergy had paid for their pardon
with a heavy fine and the loss of their independence, the laity paid
nothing at all. The last business of the session was the reading of
the sentences in Henry's favour obtained from the
universities.<a id="footnotetag798" name="footnotetag798"></a><a href="#footnote798">[798]</a>
Parliament was then prorogued, and its members were enjoined to relate
to their constituents that which they had seen and heard.</p>

<p>Primed by communion with their neighbours, members of Parliament
assembled once more on 15th January, 1532,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289"></a>(p. 289)</span>
for more important
business than they had yet transacted. Every effort was made to secure
a full attendance of Peers and Commons; almost all the lords would be
present, thought Chapuys, except Tunstall, who had not been summoned;
Fisher came without a summons, and apparently no effort was made to
exclude him.<a id="footnotetag799" name="footnotetag799"></a><a href="#footnote799">[799]</a>
The readiness of the Commons to pass measures
against the Church, and their reluctance to consent to taxation, were
even more marked than before. Their critical spirit was shown by their
repeated rejection of the Statutes of Wills and Uses designed by Henry
to protect from evasion his feudal rights, such as reliefs and primer
seisins.<a id="footnotetag800" name="footnotetag800"></a><a href="#footnote800">[800]</a>
This demand, writes
Chapuys,<a id="footnotetag801" name="footnotetag801"></a><a href="#footnote801">[801]</a>
"has been the occasion
of strange words against the King and the Council, and in spite of all
the efforts of the King's friends, it was
rejected".<a id="footnotetag802" name="footnotetag802"></a><a href="#footnote802">[802]</a>
In the
matter of supplies they were equally outspoken; they would only grant
one-tenth and one-fifteenth, a trifling sum which Henry refused to
accept.<a id="footnotetag803" name="footnotetag803"></a><a href="#footnote803">[803]</a>
It was during this debate on the question of supplies
that two members moved that the King be asked to take back Catherine
as his
wife.<a id="footnotetag804" name="footnotetag804"></a><a href="#footnote804">[804]</a>
They would then, they urged, need no fresh armaments
and their words are reported to have been well received by the House.
The Commons were not more enthusiastic about the bill restraining the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>(p. 290)</span>
payment of annates to the Court at
Rome.<a id="footnotetag805" name="footnotetag805"></a><a href="#footnote805">[805]</a>
They did not
pay them; their grievance was against bishops in England, and they saw
no particular reason for relieving those prelates of their financial
burdens. Cromwell wrote to Gardiner that he did not know how the
annates bill would
succeed;<a id="footnotetag806" name="footnotetag806"></a><a href="#footnote806">[806]</a>
and the King had apparently to use
all his persuasion to get the bill through the Lords and the Commons.
Only temporal lords voted for it in the Upper House, and, in the
Lower, recourse was had to the rare expedient of a
division.<a id="footnotetag807" name="footnotetag807"></a><a href="#footnote807">[807]</a> In
both Houses the votes were taken in the King's presence. But it is
almost certain that his influence was brought to bear, not so much in
favour of the principle of the bill, as of the extremely ingenious
clause which left the execution of the Act in Henry's discretion, and
provided him with a powerful means of putting pressure on the Pope.
That was Henry's statement of the matter. He told Chapuys, before the
bill was passed, that the attack on annates was being made without his
consent;<a id="footnotetag808" name="footnotetag808"></a><a href="#footnote808">[808]</a>
and after it had been passed he instructed his
representatives at Rome to say that he had taken care to stop the
mouth of Parliament and to have the question of annates referred to
his decision.<a id="footnotetag809" name="footnotetag809"></a><a href="#footnote809">[809]</a>
"The King," writes the French envoy in England at
the end of March, "has been very cunning, for he has caused the nobles
and people to remit all to his will, so that the Pope may know that,
if he does nothing for him, the King has the means of punishing
him."<a id="footnotetag810" name="footnotetag810"></a><a href="#footnote810">[810]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>(p. 291)</span>
The execution of the clauses providing for the
confirmation and consecration of bishops without recourse to Rome was
also left at Henry's option.</p>

<p>But no pressure was needed to induce the Commons to attack abuses, the
weight of which they felt themselves. Early in the session they were
discussing the famous petition against the clergy, and, on 28th
February, Norfolk referred to the "infinite clamours" in Parliament
against the
Church.<a id="footnotetag811" name="footnotetag811"></a><a href="#footnote811">[811]</a>
The fact that four corrected drafts of this
petition are extant in the Record Office, is taken as conclusive proof
that it really emanated from the
Court.<a id="footnotetag812" name="footnotetag812"></a><a href="#footnote812">[812]</a>
But the drafts do not
appear to be in the known hand of any of the Government clerks. The
corrections in Cromwell's hand doubtless represent the wishes of the
King; but, even were the whole in Cromwell's hand, it would be no bar
to the hypothesis that Cromwell reduced to writing, for the King's
consideration, complaints which he heard from independent members in
his place in Parliament. The fact that nine-tenths of our modern
legislation is drawn up by Government draughtsmen, cannot be accepted
as proof that that legislation represents no popular feeling. On the
face of them, these petitions bear little evidence of Court dictation;
the grievances are not such as were felt by Henry, whose own demands
of the clergy were laid directly before Convocation,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>(p. 292)</span>
without
any pretence that they really came from the Commons. Some are similar
to those presented to the Parliament of 1515; others are directed
against abuses which recent statutes had sought, but failed, to
remedy. Such were the citation of laymen out of their dioceses, the
excessive fees taken in spiritual courts, the delay and trouble in
obtaining probates. Others complained that the clergy in Convocation
made laws inconsistent with the laws of the realm; that the ordinaries
delayed instituting parsons to their benefices; that benefices were
given to minors; that the number of holy-days, especially in
harvest-time, was excessive; and that spiritual men occupied temporal
offices. The chief grievance seems to have been that the ordinaries
cited poor men before the spiritual courts without any accuser being
produced, and then condemned them to abjure or be burnt. Henry,
reported Chapuys, was "in a most gracious manner" promising to support
the Commons against the Church "and to mitigate the rigours of the
inquisition which they have here, and which is said to be more severe
than in Spain".<a id="footnotetag813" name="footnotetag813"></a><a href="#footnote813">[813]</a></p>

<p>After debating these points in Parliament, the Commons agreed that
"all the griefs, which the temporal men should be grieved with, should
be put in writing and delivered to the King"; hence the drafts in the
Record Office. The deputation, with the Speaker at its head, presented
the complaints to Henry on 18th March. Its reception is quite
unintelligible on the theory that the grievances existed only in the
King's imagination. Henry was willing, he said, to consider the
Commons' petition. But, if they expected him to comply with their
wishes,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name="page293"></a>(p. 293)</span>
they must make some concession to his; and he
recommended them to forgo their opposition to the bills of Uses and
Wills, to which the Lords had already agreed. After Easter he sent the
Commons' petition to Convocation; the clergy appealed to the King for
protection. Henry had thus man&oelig;uvred himself into the position of
mediator, in which he hoped, but in vain, to extract profit for
himself from both
sides.<a id="footnotetag814" name="footnotetag814"></a><a href="#footnote814">[814]</a>
From Convocation he demanded submission
to three important claims; the clergy were to consent to a reform of
ecclesiastical law, to abdicate their right of independent
legislation, and to recognise the necessity of the King's approval for
existing canons. These demands were granted. As usual, Henry was able
to get what he wanted from the clergy; but from the Commons he could
get no more than they were willing to give. They again rejected the
bills of Uses and Wills, and would only concede the most paltry
supplies. But they passed with alacrity the bills embodying the
submission of the clergy. These were the Church's concessions to
Henry, but it must bend the knee to the Commons as well, and other
measures were passed reforming some of the points in their petition.
Ordinaries were prohibited from citing men out of their proper
dioceses, and benefit of clergy was denied to clerks under the order
of sub-deacon who committed murder, felony, or petty treason; the
latter was a slight extension of a statute passed in 1512. The
bishops, however, led by Gardiner and aided by
More,<a id="footnotetag815" name="footnotetag815"></a><a href="#footnote815">[815]</a>
secured in
the House of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>(p. 294)</span>
Lords the rejection of the concessions made by
the Church to the King, though they passed those made to the Commons.
Parliament, which had sat for the unusual space of four months, was
prorogued on the 14th of May; two days later, More resigned the
chancellorship and Gardiner retired in disfavour to Winchester.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>Meanwhile the divorce case at Rome made little progress. In the
highest court in Christendom the facilities afforded for the law's
delays were naturally more extended than before inferior tribunals;
and two years had been spent in discussing whether Henry's
"excusator," sent merely to maintain that the King of England could
not be cited to plead before the Papal Court, should be heard or not.
Clement was in suspense between two political forces. In December,
1532, Charles was again to interview the Pope, and imperialists in
Italy predicted that his presence would be as decisive in Catherine's
favour as it had been three years before. But Henry and Francis had,
in October, exhibited to the world the closeness of their friendship
by a personal interview at
Boulogne.<a id="footnotetag816" name="footnotetag816"></a><a href="#footnote816">[816]</a>
No pomp or ceremony, like
that of the Field of Cloth of Gold, dazzled men's eyes; but the union
between the two Kings was never more real. Neither Queen was present;
Henry would not take Catherine, and he objected so strongly to Spanish
dress that he could not endure the sight of Francis's Spanish
Queen.<a id="footnotetag817" name="footnotetag817"></a><a href="#footnote817">[817]</a>
Anne Boleyn, recently created Marquis (so she was styled,
to indicate the possession of the peerage in her own right) of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>(p. 295)</span>
Pembroke,<a id="footnotetag818" name="footnotetag818"></a><a href="#footnote818">[818]</a>
took Catherine's place; and plans for the
promotion of the divorce formed the staple of the royal discussions.
Respect for the power of the two Kings robbed the subsequent interview
between Emperor and Pope of much of its effect; and before Charles and
Clement parted, the Pope had secretly agreed to accord a similar
favour to Francis; he was to meet him at Nice in the following summer.
Long before then the divorce had been brought to a crisis. By the end
of January Henry knew that Anne Boleyn was pregnant. Her issue must at
any cost be made legitimate. That could only be done by Henry's
divorce from Catherine, and by his marriage with Anne
Boleyn.<a id="footnotetag819" name="footnotetag819"></a><a href="#footnote819">[819]</a>
There was little hope of obtaining these favours from Rome. Therefore
it must be done by means of the Archbishop of Canterbury; and to
remove all chance of disputing his sentence, the Court of the
Archbishop of Canterbury must, before his decision was given, be
recognised as the supreme tribunal for English ecclesiastical cases.</p>

<p>These circumstances, of which not a hint was suffered to transpire in
public, dictated Henry's policy during the early months of 1533. Never
was his skill more clearly displayed; he was, wrote Chapuys in
December, 1532, practising more than ever with his
Parliament,<a id="footnotetag820" name="footnotetag820"></a><a href="#footnote820">[820]</a>
though he received the Spanish ambassador "as courteously as
ever".<a id="footnotetag821" name="footnotetag821"></a><a href="#footnote821">[821]</a>
The difficulties with which he was surrounded might have
tried the nerve of any man, but they only seemed to render Henry's
course more daring and steady. The date of his marriage with Anne
Boleyn is even now a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>(p. 296)</span>
matter of
conjecture.<a id="footnotetag822" name="footnotetag822"></a><a href="#footnote822">[822]</a>
Cranmer
repudiated the report that he performed the
ceremony.<a id="footnotetag823" name="footnotetag823"></a><a href="#footnote823">[823]</a>
He declares
he did not know of it until a fortnight after the event, and says it
took place about St. Paul's Day (25th January). A more important
question was the individuality of the archbishop who was to pronounce
the nullity of Henry's marriage with Catherine of Aragon. He must
obviously be one on whom the King could rely. Fortunately for Henry,
Archbishop Warham had died in August, 1532. His successor was to be
Thomas Cranmer, who had first suggested to Henry the plan of seeking
the opinions of the universities on the divorce, and was now on an
embassy at the Emperor's Court. No time was to be lost. Henry usually
gathered a rich harvest during the vacancy of great bishoprics, but
now Canterbury was to be filled up without any delay, and the King
even lent Cranmer 1,000 marks to meet his
expenses.<a id="footnotetag824" name="footnotetag824"></a><a href="#footnote824">[824]</a>
But would the
Pope be so accommodating as to expedite the bulls, suspecting, as he
must have done, the object for which they were wanted?</p>

<p>For this contingency also Henry had provided; and he was actually
using the Pope as a means for securing the divorce. An appearance of
friendship with Clement was the weapon he now employed with the
greatest effect. The Pope was discussing with the French ambassadors a
proposal to remit the divorce case to some neutral spot, such as
Cambrai, and delaying that definite sentence in Catherine's favour
which imperialists had hoped that his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>(p. 297)</span>
interview with Charles
would
precipitate;<a id="footnotetag825" name="footnotetag825"></a><a href="#footnote825">[825]</a>
the papal nuncio was being feasted in England,
and was having suspiciously amicable conferences with members of
Henry's council. Henry himself was writing to Clement in the most
cordial terms; he had instructed his ambassadors in 1531 to "use all
gentleness towards
him,"<a id="footnotetag826" name="footnotetag826"></a><a href="#footnote826">[826]</a>
and Clement was saying that Henry was of
a better nature and more wise than Francis
I.<a id="footnotetag827" name="footnotetag827"></a><a href="#footnote827">[827]</a>
Henry was now
willing to suspend his consent to the general council, where the Pope
feared that a scheme would be mooted for restoring the papal States to
the Emperor;<a id="footnotetag828" name="footnotetag828"></a><a href="#footnote828">[828]</a>
and he told the papal nuncio in England that, though
he had studied the question of the Pope's authority and retracted his
defence of the Holy
See,<a id="footnotetag829" name="footnotetag829"></a><a href="#footnote829">[829]</a>
yet possibly Clement might give him
occasion to probe the matter further still, and to reconfirm what he
had originally
written.<a id="footnotetag830" name="footnotetag830"></a><a href="#footnote830">[830]</a>
Was he not, moreover, withholding his
assent from the Act of Annates, which would deprive the Pope of large
revenues? Backed by this gentle hint, Henry's request not merely for
Cranmer's bulls, but for their expedition without the payment of the
usual 10,000 marks, reached Rome. The cardinals were loth to forgo
their perquisites for the bulls, but the annates of all England were
more precious still, and, on 22nd February, Consistory decided to do
what Henry desired.</p>

<p>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>(p. 298)</span>
same deceptive appearance of concord between King and
Pope was employed to lull both Parliament and Convocation. The delays
in the divorce suit disheartened Catherine's adherents. The Pope,
wrote Chapuys, would lose his authority little by little, unless the
case were decided at
once;<a id="footnotetag831" name="footnotetag831"></a><a href="#footnote831">[831]</a>
every one, he said, cried out "au
murdre" on Clement for his procrastination on the divorce, and for the
speed with which he granted Cranmer's
bulls.<a id="footnotetag832" name="footnotetag832"></a><a href="#footnote832">[832]</a>
There was a general
impression that "he would betray the Emperor," and "many think that
there is a secret agreement between Henry and the
Pope".<a id="footnotetag833" name="footnotetag833"></a><a href="#footnote833">[833]</a>
That
idea was sedulously fostered by Henry. Twice he took the Pope's nuncio
down in state to Parliament to advertise the excellent terms upon
which he stood with the Holy
See.<a id="footnotetag834" name="footnotetag834"></a><a href="#footnote834">[834]</a>
In the face of such evidence,
what motive was there for prelates and others to reject the demands
which Henry was pressing upon them? The Convocations of Canterbury and
York repeated the submission of 1532, and approved, by overwhelming
majorities, of two propositions: firstly, that, as a matter of law,
the Pope was not competent to dispense with the obstacle to a marriage
between a man and his deceased brother's wife, when the previous
marriage had been consummated; and secondly, that, as a matter of
fact, the marriage between Catherine and Prince Arthur had been so
consummated.<a id="footnotetag835" name="footnotetag835"></a><a href="#footnote835">[835]</a>
In Parliament, the Act forbidding Appeals to
Rome,<a id="footnotetag836" name="footnotetag836"></a><a href="#footnote836">[836]</a>
and providing for the confirmation and consecration of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>(p. 299)</span>
bishops without recourse to the Papal Court, was discussed. It
was, like the rest of Henry's measures, based on a specious
conservative plea. General councils had, the King said, decreed that
suits should be determined in the place in which they
originated;<a id="footnotetag837" name="footnotetag837"></a><a href="#footnote837">[837]</a>
so there was no need for appeals to go out of England. Such opposition
as it encountered was based on no religious principle. Commercial
interests were the most powerful impulse of the age, and the Commons
were afraid that the Act of Appeals might be followed by a papal
interdict. They did not mind the interdict as depriving them of
religious consolations, but they dreaded lest it might ruin their
trade with the
Netherlands.<a id="footnotetag838" name="footnotetag838"></a><a href="#footnote838">[838]</a>
Henry, however, persuaded them that
the wool trade was as necessary to Flemings as it was to Englishmen,
and that an interdict would prove no more than an empty threat. He was
careful to make no other demands upon the Commons. No subsidies were
required; no extension of royal prerogative was sought; and eventually
the Act of Appeals was passed with a facility that seems to have
created general
surprise.<a id="footnotetag839" name="footnotetag839"></a><a href="#footnote839">[839]</a></p>

<p>Henry's path was now clear. Cranmer was archbishop and <i>legatus natus</i>
with a title which none could dispute. By Act of Parliament his court
was the final resort for all ecclesiastical cases. No appeals from his
decision could be lawfully made. So, on 11th April, before he was yet
consecrated, he besought the King's gracious permission to determine
his "great cause of matrimony, because much bruit exists among the
common people
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>(p. 300)</span>
on the
subject".<a id="footnotetag840" name="footnotetag840"></a><a href="#footnote840">[840]</a>
No doubt there did; but
that was not the cause for the haste. Henry was pleased to accede to
this request of the "principal minister of our spiritual
jurisdiction"; and, on the 10th of May, the Archbishop opened his
Court at Dunstable. Catherine, of course, could recognise no authority
in Cranmer to try a cause that was before the papal curia. She was
declared contumacious, and, on the 23rd, the Archbishop gave his
sentence. Following the line of Convocation, he pronounced that the
Pope had no power to license marriages such as Henry's, and that the
King and Catherine had never been husband and
wife.<a id="footnotetag841" name="footnotetag841"></a><a href="#footnote841">[841]</a>
Five days
later, after a secret investigation, he declared that Henry and Anne
Boleyn were lawfully married, and on Whitsunday, the 1st of June, he
crowned Anne as Queen in Westminster
Abbey.<a id="footnotetag842" name="footnotetag842"></a><a href="#footnote842">[842]</a>
Three months later,
on Sunday, the 7th of September, between three and four in the
afternoon, Queen Anne gave birth to a daughter at
Greenwich.<a id="footnotetag843" name="footnotetag843"></a><a href="#footnote843">[843]</a>
The
child was christened on the following Wednesday by Stokesley, Bishop
of London, and Cranmer stood godfather. Chapuys scarcely considered
the matter worth mention. The King's <i>amie</i> had given birth to a
bastard, a detail of little importance to any one, and least of all
to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>(p. 301)</span>
a monarch like Charles
V.<a id="footnotetag844" name="footnotetag844"></a><a href="#footnote844">[844]</a>
Yet the "bastard" was
Queen Elizabeth, and the child, thus ushered into a contemptuous
world, lived to humble the pride of Spain, and to bear to a final
triumph the banner which Henry had raised.</p>




<h3>CHAPTER XII.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>(p. 302)</span>
</h3>

<h4>"THE PREVAILING OF THE GATES OF HELL."</h4>


<p>That victorious issue of the Tudor struggle with the power, against
which Popes proclaimed that the gates of hell should not prevail, was
distant enough in 1533. Then the Tudor monarch seemed rushing headlong
to irretrievable ruin. Sure of himself and his people, and feeling no
longer the need of Clement's favour, Henry threw off the mask of
friendship, and, on the 9th of July, confirmed, by letters patent, the
Act of
Annates.<a id="footnotetag845" name="footnotetag845"></a><a href="#footnote845">[845]</a>
Cranmer's proceedings at Dunstable, Henry's
marriage, and Anne's coronation, constituted a still more flagrant
defiance of Catholic Europe. The Pope's authority was challenged with
every parade of contempt. He could do no less than gather round him
the relics of his dignity and prepare to launch against Henry the
final ban of the
Church.<a id="footnotetag846" name="footnotetag846"></a><a href="#footnote846">[846]</a>
So, on the 11th of July, the sentence of
the greater
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>(p. 303)</span>
excommunication was drawn up. Clement did not
yet, nor did he ever, venture to assert his claims to temporal
supremacy in Christendom, by depriving the English King of his
kingdom; he thought it prudent to rely on his own undisputed
prerogative. His spiritual powers seemed ample; and he applied to
himself the words addressed to the Prophet Jeremiah, "Behold, I have
set thee above nations and kingdoms that thou mayest root up and
destroy, build and plant, a lord over all kings of the whole earth and
over all peoples bearing
rule".<a id="footnotetag847" name="footnotetag847"></a><a href="#footnote847">[847]</a>
In virtue of this prerogative
Henry was cut off from the Church while he lived, removed from the
pale of Christian society, and deprived of the solace of the rites of
religion; when he died, he must lie without burial, and in hell suffer
torment for
ever.<a id="footnotetag848" name="footnotetag848"></a><a href="#footnote848">[848]</a></p>

<p>What would be the effect of this terrific anathema? The omens looked
ill for the English King. If he had flouted the Holy See, he had also
offended the temporal head of Christendom. The Emperor's aunt had been
divorced, his cousin's legitimacy had been impugned, and the
despatches of his envoy, Chapuys, were filled with indignant
lamentations over the treatment meted out to Catherine and to her
daughter. Both proud and stubborn women, they resolutely refused to
admit in any way the validity of Henry's acts and recent legislation.
Catherine would rather starve as Queen, than be sumptuously clothed
and fed as Princess Dowager. Henry would give her anything she asked,
if she would acknowledge that she was not the Queen, nor her daughter
the Princess; but her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304"></a>(p. 304)</span>
bold resistance to his commands and
wishes brought out all the worst features of his
character.<a id="footnotetag849" name="footnotetag849"></a><a href="#footnote849">[849]</a>
His anger was not the worst the Queen and her daughter had to fear; he
still preserved a feeling of respect for Catherine and of affection
for Mary. "The King himself," writes Chapuys, "is not ill-natured; it
is this Anne who has put him in this perverse and wicked temper, and
alienates him from his former
humanity."<a id="footnotetag850" name="footnotetag850"></a><a href="#footnote850">[850]</a>
The new Queen's jealous
malignity passed all bounds. She caused her aunt to be made governess
to Mary, and urged her to box her charge's ears; and she used every
effort to force the Princess to serve as a maid upon her little
half-sister, Elizabeth.<a id="footnotetag851" name="footnotetag851"></a><a href="#footnote851">[851]</a></p>

<p>This humiliation was deeply resented by the people, who, says Chapuys,
though forbidden, on pain of their lives, to call Catherine Queen,
shouted it at the top of their
voices.<a id="footnotetag852" name="footnotetag852"></a><a href="#footnote852">[852]</a>
"You cannot imagine," he
writes a few weeks later to Charles, "the great desire of all this
people that your Majesty should send men. Every day I have been
applied to about it by Englishmen of rank, wit and learning,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305"></a>(p. 305)</span>
who give me to understand that the last King Richard was never so much
hated by his people as this
King."<a id="footnotetag853" name="footnotetag853"></a><a href="#footnote853">[853]</a>
The Emperor, he went on, had a
better chance of success than Henry VII., and Ortiz at Rome was
cherishing the belief that England would rise against the King for his
contumacy and schismatic
disobedience.<a id="footnotetag854" name="footnotetag854"></a><a href="#footnote854">[854]</a>
Fisher was urgent that
Charles should prepare an invasion of England; the young Marquis of
Exeter, a possible claimant to the throne, was giving the same
advice.<a id="footnotetag855" name="footnotetag855"></a><a href="#footnote855">[855]</a>
Abergavenny, Darcy and other peers brooded in sullen
discontent. They were all listening to the hysterical ravings of
Elizabeth
Barton,<a id="footnotetag856" name="footnotetag856"></a><a href="#footnote856">[856]</a>
the Nun of Kent, who prophesied that Henry had
not a year to live. Charles's emissaries were busy in Ireland, where
Kildare was about to revolt. James V. of Scotland was hinting at his
claims to the English crown, should Henry be deprived by the
Pope;<a id="footnotetag857" name="footnotetag857"></a><a href="#footnote857">[857]</a>
and Chapuys was divided in mind whether it would be better
to make James the executor of the papal sentence, or marry Mary to
some great English noble, and raise an internal
rebellion.<a id="footnotetag858" name="footnotetag858"></a><a href="#footnote858">[858]</a>
At
Catherine's suggestion he recommended to the Emperor Reginald Pole, a
grandson of George, Duke of Clarence, as a suitor for Mary's hand; and
he urged, on his own account, Pole's claims to the English
throne.<a id="footnotetag859" name="footnotetag859"></a><a href="#footnote859">[859]</a>
Catherine's scruples, not about deposing her husband, or
passing over the claims of Henry's sisters, but on the score of Edward
IV.'s grandson, the Marquis of Exeter, might, thought Chapuys,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>(p. 306)</span>
be removed by appealing to the notorious sentence of Bishop
Stillington, who, on the demand of Richard III., had pronounced Edward
IV.'s marriage void and his children
illegitimate.<a id="footnotetag860" name="footnotetag860"></a><a href="#footnote860">[860]</a>
Those who had
been the King's firm supporters when the divorce first came up were
some of them wavering, and others turning
back.<a id="footnotetag861" name="footnotetag861"></a><a href="#footnote861">[861]</a>
Archbishop Lee,
Bishops Tunstall and Gardiner, and
Bennet,<a id="footnotetag862" name="footnotetag862"></a><a href="#footnote862">[862]</a>
were now all in secret
or open opposition, and even Longland was expressing to Chapuys
regrets that he had ever been Henry's
confessor;<a id="footnotetag863" name="footnotetag863"></a><a href="#footnote863">[863]</a>
like other
half-hearted revolutionists, they would never have started at all, had
they known how far they would have to go, and now they were setting
their sails for an adverse breeze. It was the King, and the King
alone, who kept England on the course which he had mapped out. Pope
and Emperor were defied; Europe was shocked; Francis himself
disapproved of the breach with the Church; Ireland was in revolt;
Scotland, as ever, was hostile; legislation had been thrust down the
throats of a recalcitrant Church, and, we are asked to believe, of a
no less unwilling House of Commons, while the people at large were
seething with indignation at the insults heaped upon the injured Queen
and her daughter. By all the laws of nature, of morals, and of
politics, it would seem, Henry was doomed to the fate of the monarch
in the Book of Daniel the
Prophet,<a id="footnotetag864" name="footnotetag864"></a><a href="#footnote864">[864]</a>
who did according to his will
and exalted and magnified himself above every god; who divided the
land for gain, and had power over the treasures of gold and silver;
who was troubled by tidings
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name="page307"></a>(p. 307)</span>
from the east and from the
north; who went forth with great fury to destroy and utterly make away
many, and yet came to his end, and none helped him.</p>

<p>All these circumstances, real and alleged, would be quite convincing
as reasons for Henry's failure; but they are singularly inconclusive
as explanations of his success, of the facts that his people did not
rise and depose him, that no Spanish Armada disgorged its host on
English shores, and that, for all the papal thunderbolts, Henry died
quietly in his bed fourteen years later, and was buried with a pomp
and respect to which Popes themselves were little accustomed. He may
have stood alone in his confidence of success, and in his penetration
through these appearances into the real truth of the situation behind.
That, from a purely political or non-moral point of view, is his chief
title to greatness. He knew from the beginning what he could do; he
had counted the cost and calculated the risks; and, writes Russell in
August, 1533, "I never saw the King merrier than he is
now".<a id="footnotetag865" name="footnotetag865"></a><a href="#footnote865">[865]</a>
As early as March, 1531, he told Chapuys that if the Pope issued 10,000
excommunications he would not care a straw for
them.<a id="footnotetag866" name="footnotetag866"></a><a href="#footnote866">[866]</a>
When the
papal nuncio first hinted at excommunication and a papal appeal to the
secular arm, Henry declared that he cared nothing for
either.<a id="footnotetag867" name="footnotetag867"></a><a href="#footnote867">[867]</a>
He
would open the eyes of princes, he said, and show them how small was
really the power of the
Pope;<a id="footnotetag868" name="footnotetag868"></a><a href="#footnote868">[868]</a>
and "when the Pope had done what he
liked on his side, Henry would do what he liked
here".<a id="footnotetag869" name="footnotetag869"></a><a href="#footnote869">[869]</a>
That
threat, at least, he fulfilled with a vengeance. He did not fear the
Spaniards; they might come, he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308"></a>(p. 308)</span>
said (as they did in 1588),
but perhaps they might not
return.<a id="footnotetag870" name="footnotetag870"></a><a href="#footnote870">[870]</a>
England, he told his subjects,
was not conquerable, so long as she remained
united;<a id="footnotetag871" name="footnotetag871"></a><a href="#footnote871">[871]</a>
and the
patriotic outburst with which Shakespeare closes "King John" is but an
echo and an expansion of the words of Henry VIII.</p>

<p class="poem">
This England never did, nor never shall,<br>
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,<br>
But when it first did help to wound itself....<br>
Come the three corners of the world in arms,<br>
And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,<br>
If England to itself do rest but true.
</p>

<p>The great fear of Englishmen was lest Charles should ruin them by
prohibiting the trade with Flanders. "Their only comfort," wrote
Chapuys, "is that the King persuades the people that it is not in your
Majesty's power to do
so."<a id="footnotetag872" name="footnotetag872"></a><a href="#footnote872">[872]</a>
Henry had put the matter to a
practical test, in the autumn of 1533, by closing the Staple at
Calais.<a id="footnotetag873" name="footnotetag873"></a><a href="#footnote873">[873]</a>
It is possible that the dispute between him and the
merchants, alleged as the cause for this step, was real; but the King
could have provided his subjects with no more forcible object-lesson.
Distress was felt at once in Flanders; complaints grew so clamorous
that the Regent sent an embassy post-haste to Henry to remonstrate,
and to represent the closing of the Staple as an infraction of
commercial treaties. Henry coldly replied that he had broken no
treaties at all; it was merely a private dispute between his merchants
and himself, in which foreign powers had no ground for intervention.
The envoys had to return, convinced against their will. The Staple at

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>(p. 309)</span>
Calais was soon reopened, but the English King was able to
demonstrate to his people that the Flemings "could not do without
England's trade, considering the outcry they made when the Staple of
Calais was closed for only three months".</p>

<p>Henry, indeed, might almost be credited with second-sight into the
Emperor's mind. On 31st May, 1533, Charles's council discussed the
situation.<a id="footnotetag874" name="footnotetag874"></a><a href="#footnote874">[874]</a>
After considering Henry's enormities, the councillors
proceeded to deliberate on the possible remedies. There were three:
justice, force and a combination of both. The objections to relying on
methods of justice, that is, on the papal sentence, were, firstly,
that Henry would not obey, and secondly, that the Pope was not to be
trusted. The objections to the employment of force were, that war
would imperil the whole of Europe, and especially the Emperor's
dominions, and that Henry had neither used violence towards Catherine
nor given Charles any excuse for breaking the Treaty of Cambrai.
Eventually, it was decided to leave the matter to Clement. He was to
be urged to give sentence against Henry, but on no account to lay
England under an interdict, as that "would disturb her intercourse
with Spain and Flanders. If, therefore, an interdict be resorted to,
it should be limited to one diocese, or to the place where Henry
dwells."<a id="footnotetag875" name="footnotetag875"></a><a href="#footnote875">[875]</a>
Such an interdict might put a premium on assassination,
but otherwise neither Henry nor his people were likely to care much
about it. The Pope should, however, be exhorted to depose the English
King; that might pave the way for Mary's accession and for the
predominance in England of the Emperor's influence; but the execution
of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>(p. 310)</span>
sentence must not be entrusted to
Charles.<a id="footnotetag876" name="footnotetag876"></a><a href="#footnote876">[876]</a>
It would be excellent if James V. or the Irish would undertake to beard
the lion in his den, but the Emperor did not see his way clear to
accepting the risk himself.</p>

<p>Charles was, indeed, afraid, not merely of Henry, but of Francis, who
was meditating fresh Italian schemes; and various expedients were
suggested to divert his attention in other directions. He might be
assisted in an attack upon Calais. "Calais," was Charles's cautious
comment, "is better as it is, for the security of
Flanders."<a id="footnotetag877" name="footnotetag877"></a><a href="#footnote877">[877]</a>
The
Pope hinted that the grant of Milan would win over Francis. It
probably would; but Charles would have abandoned half a dozen aunts
rather than see Milan in French possession. His real concern in the
matter was not the injustice to Catherine, but the destruction of the
prospect of Mary's succession. That was a tangible political interest,
and Charles was much less anxious to have Henry censured than to have
Mary's legitimate claim to the throne
established.<a id="footnotetag878" name="footnotetag878"></a><a href="#footnote878">[878]</a>
He was a great
politician, absolutely impervious to personal wrong when its remedy
conflicted with political interests. "Though the Emperor," he said,
"is bound to the Queen, this is a private matter, and public
considerations must be taken into account." And public considerations,
as he admitted a year later, "compelled him to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311"></a>(p. 311)</span>
conciliate
Henry".<a id="footnotetag879" name="footnotetag879"></a><a href="#footnote879">[879]</a>
So he refused Chapuys' request to be recalled lest his
presence in England should lead people to believe that Charles had
condoned Henry's marriage with Anne
Boleyn,<a id="footnotetag880" name="footnotetag880"></a><a href="#footnote880">[880]</a>
and dissuaded
Catherine from leaving
England.<a id="footnotetag881" name="footnotetag881"></a><a href="#footnote881">[881]</a>
The least hint to Francis of any
hostile intent towards Henry would, thought Charles, be at once
revealed to the English King, and the two would join in making war on
himself. War he was determined to avoid, for, apart from the ruin of
Flanders, which it would involve, Henry and Francis had long been
intriguing with the Lutherans in Germany. A breach might easily
precipitate civil strife in the Empire; and, indeed, in June, 1534,
Würtemberg was wrested from the Habsburgs by Philip of Hesse with the
connivance of France. Francis, too, was always believed to have a
working agreement with the Turk; Barbarossa was giving no little cause
for alarm in the Mediterranean; while Henry on his part had
established close relations with Lübeck and Hamburg, and was fomenting
dissensions in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>(p. 312)</span>
Denmark, the crown of which he was offered
but cautiously
declined.<a id="footnotetag882" name="footnotetag882"></a><a href="#footnote882">[882]</a></p>

<p>This incurable jealousy between Francis and Charles made the French
King loth to weaken his friendship with Henry. The English King was
careful to impress upon the French ambassador that he could, in the
last resort, make his peace with Charles by taking back Catherine and
by restoring Mary to her place in the line of
succession.<a id="footnotetag883" name="footnotetag883"></a><a href="#footnote883">[883]</a>
Francis
had too poignant a recollection of the results of the union between
Henry and Charles from 1521 to 1525 ever to risk its renewal. The age
of the crusades and chivalry was gone; commercial and national
rivalries were as potent in the sixteenth century as they are to-day.
Then, as in subsequent times, mutual suspicions made impossible an
effective concert of Europe against the Turk. The fall of Rhodes and
the death of one of Charles's brothers-in-law at Mohacz and the
expulsion of another from the throne of Denmark had never been
avenged, and, in 1534, the Emperor was compelled to evacuate
Coron.<a id="footnotetag884" name="footnotetag884"></a><a href="#footnote884">[884]</a>
If Europe could not combine against the common enemy of
the Faith, was it likely to combine against one who, in spite of all
his enormities, was still an orthodox Christian? And, without a
combination of princes to execute them, papal censures,
excommunications, interdicts, and all the spiritual paraphernalia,
served only to probe the hollowness of papal pretensions, and to
demonstrate the deafness of Europe to the calls of religious
enthusiasm. In Spain, at least, it might have been thought
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313"></a>(p. 313)</span>
that every sword would leap from its scabbard at a summons from
Charles on behalf of the Spanish Queen. "Henry," wrote Chapuys, "has
always fortified himself by the consent of
Parliament."<a id="footnotetag885" name="footnotetag885"></a><a href="#footnote885">[885]</a>
It would
be well, he thought, if Charles would follow suit, and induce the
Cortes of Aragon and Castile, "or at least the grandees," to offer
their persons and goods in Catherine's cause. Such an offer, if
published in England, "will be of inestimable service". But here comes
the proof of Charles's pitiful impotence; in order to obtain this
public offer, the Emperor was "to give them privately an exemption
from such offer and promise of persons and goods". It was to be one
more pretence like the others, and unfortunately for the Pope and for
the Emperor, Henry had an inconvenient habit of piercing disguises.</p>

<p>The strength of Henry's position at home was due to a similar lack of
unity among his domestic enemies. If the English people had wished to
depose him, they could have effected their object without much
difficulty. In estimating the chances of a possible invasion, it was
pointed out how entirely dependent Henry was upon his people: he had
only one castle in London, and only a hundred yeomen of the guard to
defend him.<a id="footnotetag886" name="footnotetag886"></a><a href="#footnote886">[886]</a>
He would, in fact, have been powerless against a
united people or even against a partial revolt, if well organised and
really popular. There was chronic discontent throughout the Tudor
period, but it was sectional. The remnants of the old nobility always
hated Tudor methods of government, and the poorer commons were sullen
at their ill-treatment by the lords of the land; but there was no
concerted basis
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314"></a>(p. 314)</span>
of action between the two. The dominant
class was commercial, and it had no grievance against Henry, while it
feared alike the lords and the lower orders. In the spoliation of the
Church temporal lords and commercial men, both of whom could profit
thereby, were agreed; and nowhere was there much sympathy with the
Church as an institution apart from its doctrine. Chapuys himself
admits that the act, depriving the clergy of their profits from
leases, was passed "to please the
people";<a id="footnotetag887" name="footnotetag887"></a><a href="#footnote887">[887]</a>
and another
conservative declared that, if the Church were deprived of all its
temporal goods, many would be glad and few would
bemoan.<a id="footnotetag888" name="footnotetag888"></a><a href="#footnote888">[888]</a>
Sympathy
with Catherine and hatred of Anne were general, but people thought,
like Charles, that these were private griefs, and that public
considerations must be taken into account. Englishmen are at all times
reluctant to turn out one Government until they see at least the
possibility of another to take its place, and the only alternative to
Henry VIII. was anarchy. The opposition could not agree on a policy,
and they could not agree on a leader. There were various grandchildren
of Edward IV. and of Clarence, who might put forward distant claims to
the throne; and there were other candidates in whose multitude lay
Henry's safety. It was quite certain that the pushing of any one of
these claimants would throw the rest on Henry's side. James V., whom
at one time Chapuys favoured, knew that a Scots invasion would unite
the whole of England against him; and Charles was probably wise in
rebuking his ambassador's zeal, and in thinking that any attempt on
his own part would be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>(p. 315)</span>
more disastrous to himself than to
Henry.<a id="footnotetag889" name="footnotetag889"></a><a href="#footnote889">[889]</a>
For all this, the English King was, as Chapuys remarks,
keeping a very watchful eye on the countenance of his
people,<a id="footnotetag890" name="footnotetag890"></a><a href="#footnote890">[890]</a>
seeing how far he could go and where he must stop, and neglecting no
precaution for the peace and security of himself and his kingdom. Acts
were passed to strengthen the navy, improvements in arms and armament
were being continually tested, and the fortifications at Calais, on
the Scots Borders and elsewhere were strengthened. Wales was reduced
to law and order, and, through the intermediation of Francis, a
satisfactory peace was made with
Scotland.<a id="footnotetag891" name="footnotetag891"></a><a href="#footnote891">[891]</a></p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>Convinced of his security from attack at home and abroad, Henry
proceeded to accomplish what remained for the subjugation of the
Church in England and the final breach with Rome. Clement had no
sooner excommunicated Henry than he began to repent; he was much more
alarmed than the English King at the probable effects of his sentence.
Henry at once recalled his ambassadors from Rome, and drew up an
appeal to a General
Council.<a id="footnotetag892" name="footnotetag892"></a><a href="#footnote892">[892]</a>
The Pope feared he would lose
England for ever. Even the Imperialists proved but Job's comforters,
and told him that, after all, it was only "an unprofitable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>(p. 316)</span>
island,"<a id="footnotetag893" name="footnotetag893"></a><a href="#footnote893">[893]</a>
the loss of which was not to be compared with the
renewed devotion of Spain and the Emperor's other dominions; possibly
they assured him that there would never again be a sack of Rome.
Clement delayed for a time the publication of the sentence against
Henry, and in November he went to his interview with Francis I. at
Marseilles.<a id="footnotetag894" name="footnotetag894"></a><a href="#footnote894">[894]</a>
While he was there, Bonner intimated to him Henry's
appeal to a General Council. Clement angrily rejected the appeal as
frivolous, and Francis regarded this defiance of the Pope as an
affront to himself in the person of his guest, and as the ruin of his
attempts to reconcile the two parties. "Ye have clearly marred all,"
he said to Gardiner; "as fast as I study to win the Pope, you study to
lose him,"<a id="footnotetag895" name="footnotetag895"></a><a href="#footnote895">[895]</a>
and he declared that, had he known of the intimation
beforehand, it should never have been made. Henry, however, had no
desire that the Pope should be
won.<a id="footnotetag896" name="footnotetag896"></a><a href="#footnote896">[896]</a>
He was, he told the French
ambassador, determined to separate from Rome; "he will not, in
consequence of this, be less Christian, but more so, for in everything
and in every place he desires to cause Jesus Christ to be recognised,
who alone is the patron of Christians; and he will cause the Word to
be preached, and not the canons and decrees of the
Pope."<a id="footnotetag897" name="footnotetag897"></a><a href="#footnote897">[897]</a></p>

<p>Parliament
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317"></a>(p. 317)</span>
was to meet to effect this purpose in January,
1534, and during the previous autumn there are the first indications,
traceable to Cromwell's hand, of an attempt to pack it. He drew up a
memorandum of such seats as were vacant from death or from other
causes; most of the new members appear to have been freely elected,
but four vacancies were filled by "the King's
pleasure."<a id="footnotetag898" name="footnotetag898"></a><a href="#footnote898">[898]</a>
More
extensive and less doubtful was the royal interference in the election
of abbots. Many abbeys fell vacant in 1533, and in every case
commissioners were sent down to secure the election of the King's
nominee; in many others, abbots were induced to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318"></a>(p. 318)</span>
resign, and
fresh ones put in their
place.<a id="footnotetag899" name="footnotetag899"></a><a href="#footnote899">[899]</a>
It is not clear that the main
object was to pack the clerical representation in the House of Lords,
because only a few of these abbots had seats there, the abbots gave
much less trouble than the bishops in Parliament, and Convocation,
where they largely outnumbered the bishops, was much more amenable
than the House of Peers, where the bishops' votes preponderated. It is
more probable that the end in view was already the dissolution of the
monasteries by means of surrender. Cromwell, who was now said to "rule
everything,"<a id="footnotetag900" name="footnotetag900"></a><a href="#footnote900">[900]</a>
was boasting that he would make his King the richest
monarch in Christendom, and his methods may be guessed from his praise
of the Sultan as a model to other princes for the authority he wielded
over his
subjects.<a id="footnotetag901" name="footnotetag901"></a><a href="#footnote901">[901]</a>
Henry, however, was fortunate in 1533, even in
the matter of episcopal representation. He had, since the fall of
Wolsey, had occasion to fill up the Sees of York, Winchester, London,
Durham and Canterbury; and in this year five more became vacant:
Bangor, Ely, Coventry and Lichfield by death, and Salisbury and
Worcester through the deprivation by Act of Parliament of their
foreign and absentee pastors, Campeggio and
Ghinucci.<a id="footnotetag902" name="footnotetag902"></a><a href="#footnote902">[902]</a>
Of the
other bishops, Clerk of Bath and Wells, and Longland of Lincoln, had
been active in the divorce, which, indeed, Longland, the King's
confessor, was said to have originally suggested about the year 1523;
the Bishops of Norwich
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name="page319"></a>(p. 319)</span>
and of Chichester were both over
ninety years of
age.<a id="footnotetag903" name="footnotetag903"></a><a href="#footnote903">[903]</a>
Llandaff was Catherine's confessor, a
Spaniard who could not speak a word of English. On the whole bench
there was no one but Fisher of Rochester who had the will or the
courage to make any effective stand on behalf of the Church's liberty.</p>

<p>Before Parliament met Francis sent Du Bellay, Bishop of Paris, to
London to make one last effort to keep the peace between England and
Rome. Du Bellay could get no concessions of any value from Henry. All
the King would promise was that, if Clement would before Easter
declare his marriage with Catherine null and that with Anne valid, he
would not complete the extirpation of the papal
authority.<a id="footnotetag904" name="footnotetag904"></a><a href="#footnote904">[904]</a>
Little
enough of that remained, and Henry himself had probably no expectation
and no wish that his terms should be accepted. Long before Du Bellay
had reached Rome, Parliament was discussing measures designed to
effect the final severance. Opposition was of the feeblest character
alike in Convocation and in both Houses of Parliament. Chapuys himself
gloomily prophesied that there would be no difficulty in getting the
principal measures, abolishing the Pope's authority and arranging for
the election of bishops, through the House of
Lords.<a id="footnotetag905" name="footnotetag905"></a><a href="#footnote905">[905]</a>
The second
Act of Appeals embodied the concessions made by Convocation in 1532
and rejected that year in the House of Lords. Convocation was neither
to meet nor to legislate without the King's assent; Henry might
appoint a royal commission to reform the canon
law;<a id="footnotetag906" name="footnotetag906"></a><a href="#footnote906">[906]</a>
appeals were
to be permitted to Chancery from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320"></a>(p. 320)</span>
the Archbishop's
Court;<a id="footnotetag907" name="footnotetag907"></a><a href="#footnote907">[907]</a>
abbeys and other religious houses, which had been exempt
from episcopal authority, were placed immediately under the
jurisdiction of Chancery. A fresh Act of Annates defined more
precisely the new method of electing bishops, and provided that, if
the Chapter did not elect the royal nominee within twelve days, the
King might appoint him by letters patent. A third act forbade the
payment of Peter-pence and other impositions to the Court of Rome, and
handed over the business of dispensations and licences to the
Archbishop of Canterbury; at the same time it declared that neither
King nor realm meant to vary from the articles of the Catholic Faith
of Christendom.</p>

<p>Another act provided that charges of heresy must be supported by two
lay witnesses, and that indictments for that offence could only be
made by lay authorities. This, like the rest of Henry's
anti-ecclesiastical legislation, was based on popular clamour. On the
5th of March the whole House of Commons, with the Speaker at their
head, had waited on the King at York Place and expatiated for three
hours on the oppressiveness of clerical jurisdiction. At length it was
agreed that eight temporal peers, eight representatives of the Lower
House and sixteen bishops "should discuss the matter and the King be
umpire"<a id="footnotetag908" name="footnotetag908"></a><a href="#footnote908">[908]</a>&mdash;a
repetition of the plan of 1529 and a very exact
reflection of Henry's methods and of the Church-and-State situation
during the Reformation Parliament.</p>

<p>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page321" name="page321"></a>(p. 321)</span>
final act of the session, which ended on 30th March, was
a constitutional innovation of the utmost importance. From the
earliest ages the succession to the crown had in theory been
determined, first by election, and then by hereditary right. In
practice it had often been decided by the barbarous arbitrament of
war. For right is vague, it may be disputed, and there was endless
variety of opinion as to the proper claimant to the throne if Henry
should die. So vague right was to be replaced by definite law, which
could not be disputed, but which, unlike right, could easily be
changed. The succession was no longer to be regulated by an
unalterable principle, but by the popular (or royal) will expressed in
Acts of
Parliament.<a id="footnotetag909" name="footnotetag909"></a><a href="#footnote909">[909]</a>
The first of a long series of Acts of
Succession was now passed to vest the succession to the crown in the
heirs of the King by Anne Boleyn; clauses were added declaring that
persons who impugned that marriage by writing, printing, or other deed
were guilty of treason, and those who impugned it by words, of
misprision. The Government proposal that both classes of offenders
should be held guilty of treason was modified by the House of
Commons.<a id="footnotetag910" name="footnotetag910"></a><a href="#footnote910">[910]</a></p>

<p>On 23rd March, a week before the prorogation of Parliament, and seven
years after the divorce case had first begun, Clement gave sentence at
Rome pronouncing valid the marriage between Catherine and
Henry.<a id="footnotetag911" name="footnotetag911"></a><a href="#footnote911">[911]</a>
The decision produced not a ripple on the surface of English affairs;
Henry, writes Chapuys, took no account of it and was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322"></a>(p. 322)</span>
making
as good cheer as
ever.<a id="footnotetag912" name="footnotetag912"></a><a href="#footnote912">[912]</a>
There was no reason why he should not.
While the imperialist mob at Rome after its kind paraded the streets
in crowds, shouting "Imperio et Espagne," and firing <i>feux-de-joie</i>
over the news, the imperialist agent was writing to Charles that the
judgment would not be of much profit, except for the Emperor's honour
and the Queen's justification, and was congratulating his master that
he was not bound to execute the
sentence.<a id="footnotetag913" name="footnotetag913"></a><a href="#footnote913">[913]</a>
Flemings were tearing
down the papal censures from the doors of their
churches,<a id="footnotetag914" name="footnotetag914"></a><a href="#footnote914">[914]</a>
and
Charles was as convinced as ever of the necessity of Henry's
friendship. He proposed to the Pope that some one should be sent from
Rome to join Chapuys in "trying to move the King from his error"; and
Clement could only reply that "he thought the embassy would have no
effect on the King, but that nothing would be lost by it, and it would
be a good
compliment!"<a id="footnotetag915" name="footnotetag915"></a><a href="#footnote915">[915]</a>
Henry, however was less likely to be
influenced by compliments, good or bad, than by the circumstance that
neither Pope nor Emperor was in a position to employ any ruder
persuasive. There was none so poor as to reverence a Pope, and, when
Clement died six months later, the Roman populace broke into the
chamber where he lay and stabbed his corpse; they were with difficulty
prevented from dragging it in degradation through the
streets.<a id="footnotetag916" name="footnotetag916"></a><a href="#footnote916">[916]</a>
Such was the respect paid to the Supreme Pontiff in the Holy City, and
deference to his sentence was not to be expected in more distant
parts.</p>

<p>Henry's political education was now complete; the events of the last
five years had proved to him the truth of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page323" name="page323"></a>(p. 323)</span>
the assertion,
with which he had started, that the Pope might do what he liked at
Rome, but that he also could do what he liked in England, so long as
he avoided the active hostility of the majority of his lay subjects.
The Church had, by its actions, shown him that it was powerless; the
Pope had proved the impotence of his spiritual weapons; and the
Emperor had admitted that he was both unable and unwilling to
interfere. Henry had realised the extent of his power, and the opening
of his eyes had an evil effect upon his character. Nothing makes men
or Governments so careless or so arbitrary as the knowledge that there
will be no effective opposition to their desires. Henry, at least,
never grew careless; his watchful eye was always wide open. His ear
was always strained to catch the faintest rumbling of a coming storm,
and his subtle intellect was ever on the alert to take advantage of
every turn in the diplomatic game. He was always efficient, and he
took good care that his ministers should be so as well. But he grew
very arbitrary; the knowledge that he could do so much became with him
an irresistible reason for doing it. Despotic power is twice cursed;
it debases the ruler and degrades the subject; and Henry's progress to
despotism may be connected with the rise of Thomas Cromwell, who
looked to the Great Turk as a model for Christian
princes.<a id="footnotetag917" name="footnotetag917"></a><a href="#footnote917">[917]</a>
Cromwell became secretary in May, 1534; in that month Henry's security
was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page324" name="page324"></a>(p. 324)</span>
enhanced by the definitive peace with
Scotland,<a id="footnotetag918" name="footnotetag918"></a><a href="#footnote918">[918]</a>
and
he set to work to enforce his authority with the weapons which
Parliament had placed in his hands. Elizabeth Barton, and her
accomplices, two Friars Observants, two monks, and one secular priest,
all attainted of treason by Act of Parliament, were sent to the
block.<a id="footnotetag919" name="footnotetag919"></a><a href="#footnote919">[919]</a>
Commissioners were sent round, as Parliament had ordained,
to enforce the oath of succession throughout the
land.<a id="footnotetag920" name="footnotetag920"></a><a href="#footnote920">[920]</a>
A general
refusal would have stopped Henry's career, but the general consent
left Henry free to deal as he liked with the exceptions. Fisher and
More were sent to the Tower. They were willing to swear to the
succession, regarding that as a matter within the competence of
Parliament, but they refused to take the oath required by the
commissioners;<a id="footnotetag921" name="footnotetag921"></a><a href="#footnote921">[921]</a>
it contained, they alleged, a repudiation of the
Pope not justified by the terms of the statute. Two cartloads of
friars followed them to the Tower in June, and the Order of
Observants, in whose church at Greenwich Henry had been baptised and
married, and of whom in his earlier years he had written in terms of
warm admiration, was suppressed
altogether.<a id="footnotetag922" name="footnotetag922"></a><a href="#footnote922">[922]</a></p>

<p>In November
Parliament<a id="footnotetag923" name="footnotetag923"></a><a href="#footnote923">[923]</a>
reinforced the Act of Succession by laying
down the precise terms of the oath, and providing that a certificate
of refusal signed by two commissioners was as effective as the
indictment of twelve jurors. Other acts empowered the King to repeal
by royal proclamation certain statutes regulating imports and exports.
The first-fruits and tenths, of which the Pope had been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page325" name="page325"></a>(p. 325)</span>
already deprived, were now conferred on the King as a fitting
ecclesiastical endowment for the Supreme Head of the Church. That
title, granted him four years before by both Convocations, was
confirmed by Act of Parliament; its object was to enable the King as
Supreme Head to effect the "increase of virtue in Christ's Religion
within this Realm of England, and to repress and extirp all Errors,
Heresies and other Enormities, and Abuses heretofore used in the
same". The Defender of the Faith was to be armed with more than a
delegate power; he was to be supreme in himself, the champion not of
the Faith of any one else, but of his own; and the qualifying clause,
"as far as the law of Christ allows," was omitted. His orthodoxy must
be above suspicion, or at least beyond the reach of open cavil in
England. So new treasons were enacted, and any one who called the King
a heretic, schismatic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper, was rendered
liable to the heaviest penalty which the law could inflict. As an
earnest of the royal and parliamentary desire for an increase of
virtue in religion, an act was concurrently passed providing for the
creation of a number of suffragan
bishops.<a id="footnotetag924" name="footnotetag924"></a><a href="#footnote924">[924]</a></p>

<p>Henry was now Pope in England with powers no Pope had
possessed.<a id="footnotetag925" name="footnotetag925"></a><a href="#footnote925">[925]</a>
The Reformation is variously regarded as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name="page326"></a>(p. 326)</span>
the liberation of
the English Church from the Roman yoke it had long impatiently borne,
as its subjection to an Erastian yoke which it was henceforth, with
more or less patience, long to bear, or as a comparatively unimportant
assertion of a supremacy which Kings of England had always enjoyed.
The Church is the same Church, we are told, before and after the
change; if anything, it was Protestant before the Reformation, and
Catholic after. It is, of course, the same Church. A man may be
described as the same man before and after death, and the business of
a coroner's jury is to establish the identity; but it does not ignore
the vital difference. Even Saul and Paul were the same man. And the
identity of the Church before and after the legislation of Henry VIII.
covers a considerable number of not unimportant changes. It does not,
however, seem strictly accurate to say that Henry either liberated or
enslaved the Church. Rather, he substituted one form of despotism for
another, a sole for a dual control; the change, complained a reformer,
was merely a <i>translatio
imperii</i>.<a id="footnotetag926" name="footnotetag926"></a><a href="#footnote926">[926]</a>
The democratic movement within
the Church had died away, like the democratic movements in national
and municipal politics, before the end of the fifteenth century. It
was never merry with the
Church,<a id="footnotetag927" name="footnotetag927"></a><a href="#footnote927">[927]</a>
complained a Catholic in 1533,
since the time when bishops were wont to be chosen by the Holy Ghost
and by their Chapters.</p>

<p>Since then the Church had been governed by a partnership between King
and Pope, without much regard for the votes of the shareholders. It
was not Henry who first
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page327" name="page327"></a>(p. 327)</span>
deprived them of influence; neither
did he restore it. What he did was to eject his foreign partner,
appropriate his share of the profits, and put his part of the business
into the hands of a manager. First-fruits and tenths were described as
an intolerable burden; but they were not abolished; they were merely
transferred from the Pope to the King. Bishops became royal nominees,
pure and simple, instead of the joint nominees of King and Pope. The
supreme appellate jurisdiction in ecclesiastical causes was taken away
from Rome, but it was not granted the English Church to which in truth
it had never
belonged.<a id="footnotetag928" name="footnotetag928"></a><a href="#footnote928">[928]</a>
Chancery, and not the Archbishop's Court,
was made the final resort for ecclesiastical appeals. The authority,
divided erstwhile between two, was concentrated in the hands of one;
and that one was thus placed in a far different position from that
which either had held before.</p>

<p>The change was analogous to that in Republican Rome from two consuls
to one dictator. In both cases the dictatorship was due to exceptional
circumstances. There had long been a demand for reform in the Church
in England as well as elsewhere, but the Church was powerless to
reform itself. The dual control was in effect, as dual controls often
are, a practical anarchy. The condition of the Church before the
Reformation may be compared with that of France before the Revolution.
In purely spiritual matters the Pope was supreme: the conciliar
movement
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name="page328"></a>(p. 328)</span>
of the fifteenth century had failed. The Pope had
gathered all powers to himself, in much the same way as the French
monarch in the eighteenth century had done; and the result was the
same, a formal despotism and a real anarchy. Pope and Monarch were
crushed by the weight of their own authority; they could not reform,
even when they wanted to. From 1500 to 1530 almost every scheme,
peaceful or bellicose, started in Europe was based on the plea that
its ultimate aim was the reform of the Church; and so it would have
continued, <i>vox et præterea nihil</i>, had not the Church been galvanised
into action by the loss of half its inheritance.</p>

<p>In England the change from a dual to a sole control at once made that
control effective, and reform became possible. But it was a reform
imposed on the Church from without and by means of the exceptional
powers bestowed on the Supreme Head. Hence the burden of modern
clerical criticism of the Reformation. Objection is raised not so much
to the things that were done, as to the means by which they were
brought to pass, to the fact that the Church was forcibly reformed by
the State, and not freed from the trammels of Rome, and then left to
work out its own salvation. But such a solution occurred to few at
that time; the best and the worst of Henry's opponents opposed him on
the ground that he was divorcing the Church in England from the Church
universal. Their objection was to what was done more than to the way
in which it was done; and Sir Thomas More would have fought the
Reformation quite as strenuously had it been effected by the
Convocations of Canterbury and York. On the other side there was
equally
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329"></a>(p. 329)</span>
little thought of a Reformation by clerical hands.
Henry and Cromwell carried on and developed the tradition of the
Emperor Frederick II. and Peter de
Vinea,<a id="footnotetag929" name="footnotetag929"></a><a href="#footnote929">[929]</a>
of Philippe le Bel and
Pierre Dubois, of Lewis the Bavarian and Marsiglio of
Padua<a id="footnotetag930" name="footnotetag930"></a><a href="#footnote930">[930]</a> who
maintained the supremacy of the temporal over the spiritual power and
asserted that the clergy wielded no jurisdiction and only bore the
keys of heaven in the capacity of
turnkeys.<a id="footnotetag931" name="footnotetag931"></a><a href="#footnote931">[931]</a>
It was a question of
the national State against the universal Church. The idea of a
National Church was a later development, the result and not the cause
of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Henry's dictatorship was also temporary in character. His supremacy
over the Church was royal, and not parliamentary. It was he, and not
Parliament, who had been invested with a semi-ecclesiastical nature.
In one capacity he was head of the State, in another, head of the
Church. Parliament and Convocation were co-ordinate one with another,
and subordinate both to the King. The Tudors, and especially
Elizabeth, vehemently denied to their Parliaments any share in their
ecclesiastical powers. Their supremacy over the Church was their own,
and, as a really effective control, it died with them. As the
authority of the Crown declined, its secular powers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>(p. 330)</span>
were
seized by Parliament; its ecclesiastical powers fell into abeyance
between Parliament and Convocation. Neither has been able to vindicate
an exclusive claim to the inheritance; and the result of this dual
claim to control has been a state of helplessness, similar in some
respects to that from which the Church was rescued by the violent
methods of Henry VIII.<a id="footnotetag932" name="footnotetag932"></a><a href="#footnote932">[932]</a></p>




<h3>CHAPTER XIII.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page331" name="page331"></a>(p. 331)</span>
</h3>

<h4>THE CRISIS.</h4>


<p>Henry's title as Supreme Head of the Church was incorporated in the
royal style by letters patent of 15th January,
1535,<a id="footnotetag933" name="footnotetag933"></a><a href="#footnote933">[933]</a>
and that
year was mainly employed in compelling its recognition by all sorts
and conditions of men. In April, Houghton, the Prior of the
Charterhouse, a monk of Sion, and the Vicar of Isleworth, were the
first victims offered to the Supreme Head. But the machinery supplied
by Parliament was barely sufficient to bring the penalties of the
statute to bear on the two most illustrious of Henry's opponents,
Fisher and More. Both had been attainted of misprision of treason by
Acts of Parliament in the previous autumn; but those penalties
extended no further than to lifelong imprisonment and forfeiture of
goods. Their lives could only be exacted by proving that they had
maliciously attempted to deprive Henry of his title of Supreme
Head;<a id="footnotetag934" name="footnotetag934"></a><a href="#footnote934">[934]</a>
their opportunities in the Tower
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page332" name="page332"></a>(p. 332)</span>
for compassing
that end were limited; and it is possible that they would not have
been further molested, but for the thoughtlessness of Clement's
successor, Paul III. Impotent to effect anything against the King, the
Pope did his best to sting Henry to fury by creating Fisher a cardinal
on 20th May. He afterwards explained that he meant no harm, but the
harm was done, and it involved Fisher's friend and ally, Sir Thomas
More. Henry declared that he would send the new cardinal's head to
Rome for the hat; and he immediately despatched commissioners to the
Tower to inform Fisher and More that, unless they acknowledged the
royal supremacy, they would be put to death as
traitors.<a id="footnotetag935" name="footnotetag935"></a><a href="#footnote935">[935]</a>
Fisher
apparently denied the King's supremacy, More refused to answer; he
was, however, entrapped during a conversation with the
Solicitor-General, Rich, into an admission that Englishmen could not
be bound to acknowledge a supremacy over the Church in which other
countries did not concur. In neither case was it clear that they came
within the clutches of the law. Fisher, indeed, had really been guilty
of treason. More than once he had urged Chapuys to press upon Charles
the invasion of England, a fact unknown, perhaps, to the English
Government.<a id="footnotetag936" name="footnotetag936"></a><a href="#footnote936">[936]</a>
The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333"></a>(p. 333)</span>
evidence it had collected was, however,
considered sufficient by the juries which tried the prisoners; Fisher
went to the scaffold on 22nd June, and More on 6th July. Condemned
justly or not by the law, both sought their death in a quarrel which
is as old as the hills and will last till the crack of doom. Where
shall we place the limits of conscience, and where those of the
national will? Is conscience a luxury which only a king may enjoy in
peace? Fisher and More refused to accommodate theirs to Acts of
Parliament, but neither believed conscience to be the supreme
tribunal.<a id="footnotetag937" name="footnotetag937"></a><a href="#footnote937">[937]</a>
More admitted that in temporal matters his conscience
was bound by the laws of England; in spiritual matters the conscience
of all was bound by the will of Christendom; and on that ground both
Fisher and he rejected the plea of conscience when urged by heretics
condemned to the flames. The dispute, indeed, passes the wit of man to
decide. If conscience must reign supreme, all government is a <i>pis
aller</i>, and in anarchy the true millennium must be found. If
conscience is deposed, man sinks to the level of the lower creation.
Human society can only be based on compromise, and compromise itself
is a matter of conscience. Fisher and More protested by their death
against a principle which they had practised in life; both they and
the heretics whom they persecuted proclaimed, as Antigone had done
thousands
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>(p. 334)</span>
of years
before,<a id="footnotetag938" name="footnotetag938"></a><a href="#footnote938">[938]</a>
that they could not obey
laws which they could not believe God had made.</p>

<p>It was the personal eminence of the victims rather than the merits of
their case that made Europe thrill with horror at the news of their
death; for thousands of others were sacrificing their lives in a
similar cause in most of the countries of Christendom. For the first
and last time in English history a cardinal's head had rolled from an
English scaffold; and Paul III. made an effort to bring into play the
artillery of his temporal powers. As supreme lord over all the princes
of the earth, he arrogated to himself the right to deprive Henry VIII.
of his kingdom; and he sent couriers to the various courts to seek
their co-operation in executing his judgment. But the weapons of
Innocent III. were rusty with age. Francis denounced the Pope's claim
as a most impudent attack on monarchical dignity; and Charles was
engaged in the conquest of Tunis. Thus Henry was able to take a high
tone in reply to the remonstrances addressed to him, and to proceed
undisturbed with the work of enforcing his royal supremacy. The autumn
was occupied mainly by a visitation of the monasteries and of the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge; the schoolmen, Thomas Aquinas,
Duns Scotus and others were deposed from the seat of authority they
had held for so many centuries, and efforts were made to substitute
studies like that of the civil law, more in harmony with the King's
doctrine and with his views of royal authority.</p>

<p>The more boldly Henry defied the Fates, the more he was favoured by
Fortune. "Besides his trust in his subjects,"
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335"></a>(p. 335)</span>
wrote Chapuys
in 1534, "he has great hope in the Queen's
death;"<a id="footnotetag939" name="footnotetag939"></a><a href="#footnote939">[939]</a>
and the year
1536 was but eight days old when the unhappy Catherine was released
from her trials, resolutely refusing to the last to acknowledge in any
way the invalidity of her marriage with Henry. She had derived some
comfort from the papal sentence in her favour, but that was not
calculated to soften the harshness with which she was treated. Her
pious soul, too, was troubled with the thought that she had been the
occasion, innocent though she was, of the heresies that had arisen in
England, and of the enormities which had been practised against the
Church. Her last days were cheered by a visit from
Chapuys,<a id="footnotetag940" name="footnotetag940"></a><a href="#footnote940">[940]</a>
who
went down to Kimbolton on New Year's Day and stayed until the 5th of
January, when the Queen seemed well on the road to recovery. Three
days later she passed away, and on the 29th she was buried with the
state of a princess dowager in the church of the Benedictine abbey at
Peterborough. Her physician told Chapuys that he suspected poison, but
the symptoms are now declared, on high medical authority, to have been
those of cancer of the
heart.<a id="footnotetag941" name="footnotetag941"></a><a href="#footnote941">[941]</a>
The suspicion was the natural
result of the circumstance that her death relieved the King of a
pressing anxiety. "God be praised!" he exclaimed, "we are free from
all suspicion of
war;"<a id="footnotetag942" name="footnotetag942"></a><a href="#footnote942">[942]</a>
and on the following day he proclaimed his
joy by appearing at a ball, clad in yellow from head to
foot.<a id="footnotetag943" name="footnotetag943"></a><a href="#footnote943">[943]</a>
Every inch a King, Henry VIII. never attained to the stature of a
gentleman, but even Bishop Gardiner
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>(p. 336)</span>
wrote that by Queen
Catherine's death "God had given sentence" in the divorce suit between
her and the
King.<a id="footnotetag944" name="footnotetag944"></a><a href="#footnote944">[944]</a></p>

<p>A week later, the Reformation Parliament met for its seventh and last
session. It sat from 4th February to 14th April, and in those ten
weeks succeeded in passing no fewer than sixty-two Acts. Some were
local and some were private, but the residue contained not a few of
public importance. The fact that the King obtained at last his Statute
of Uses<a id="footnotetag945" name="footnotetag945"></a><a href="#footnote945">[945]</a>
may indicate that Henry's skill and success had so
impressed Parliament, that it was more willing to acquiesce in his
demands than it had been in its earlier sessions. But, if the drafts
in the Record Office are to be taken as indicating the proposals of
Government, and the Acts themselves are those proposals as modified in
one or other House, Parliament must have been able to enforce views of
its own to a certain extent; for those drafts differ materially from
the Acts as finally
passed.<a id="footnotetag946" name="footnotetag946"></a><a href="#footnote946">[946]</a>
Not a few of the bills were welcome,
if unusual, concessions to the clergy. They were relieved from paying
tenths in the year they paid their first-fruits. The payment of
tithes, possibly rendered doubtful in the wreck of canon law, was
enjoined by Act of Parliament. An attempt was made to deal with the
poor, and another, if not to check enclosures, at least to extract
some profit for the King from the process. It was made high treason to
counterfeit the King's sign-manual, privy signet, or privy seal; and
Henry was empowered by Parliament, as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page337" name="page337"></a>(p. 337)</span>
he had before been by
Convocation, to appoint a commission to reform the canon law. But the
chief acts of the session were for the dissolution of the lesser
monasteries and for the erection of a Court of Augmentations in order
to deal with the revenues which were thus to accrue to the King.</p>

<p>The way for this great revolution had been carefully prepared during
the previous autumn and winter. In virtue of his new and effective
supremacy, Henry had ordered a general visitation of the monasteries
throughout the greater part of the kingdom; and the reports of these
visitors were made the basis of parliamentary action. On the face of
them they represent a condition of human depravity which has rarely
been equalled;<a id="footnotetag947" name="footnotetag947"></a><a href="#footnote947">[947]</a>
and the extent to which those reports are worthy
of credit will always remain a point of contention. The visitors
themselves were men of doubtful character; indeed, respectable men
could hardly have been persuaded to do the work. Their methods were
certainly harsh; the object of their mission was to get up a case for
the Crown, and they probably used every means in their power to induce
the monks and the nuns to incriminate themselves. Perhaps, too, an
entirely false impression may be created by the fact that in most
cases only the guilty are mentioned; the innocent are often passed
over in silence, and the proportion between the two is not recorded.
Some of the terms employed in the reports are also open to dispute; it
is possible that in many instances the stigma of unchastity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>(p. 338)</span>
attached to a nun merely meant that she had been unchaste before
entering
religion,<a id="footnotetag948" name="footnotetag948"></a><a href="#footnote948">[948]</a>
and it is known that nunneries were considered
the proper resort for ladies who had not been careful enough of their
honour.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the lax state of monastic morality does not depend
only upon the visitors' reports; apart from satires like those of
Skelton, from ballads and from other mirrors of popular opinion or
prejudice, the correspondence of Henry VIII.'s reign is, from its
commencement, full of references, by bishops and other unimpeachable
witnesses, to the necessity of drastic reform. In 1516, for instance,
Bishop West of Ely visited that house, and found such disorder that he
declared its continuance would have been impossible but for his
visitation.<a id="footnotetag949" name="footnotetag949"></a><a href="#footnote949">[949]</a>
In 1518 the Italian Bishop of Worcester writes from
Rome that he had often been struck by the necessity of reforming the
monasteries.<a id="footnotetag950" name="footnotetag950"></a><a href="#footnote950">[950]</a>
In 1521 Henry VIII., then at the height of his zeal
for the Church, thanks the Bishop of Salisbury for dissolving the
nunnery of Bromehall because of the "enormities" practised
there.<a id="footnotetag951" name="footnotetag951"></a><a href="#footnote951">[951]</a>
Wolsey felt that the time for reform had passed, and began the process
of suppression, with a view to increasing the number of cathedrals and
devoting other proceeds to educational endowments. Friar Peto,
afterwards a cardinal, who had fled abroad to escape Henry's anger for
his bold denunciation of the divorce, and who had no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name="page339"></a>(p. 339)</span>
possible motive for cloaking his conscientious opinion, admitted that
there were grave abuses, and approved of the dissolution of
monasteries, if their endowments were used for proper
ends.<a id="footnotetag952" name="footnotetag952"></a><a href="#footnote952">[952]</a> There
is no need to multiply instances, because a commission of cardinals,
appointed by Paul III. himself, reported in 1537 that scandals were
frequent in religious
houses.<a id="footnotetag953" name="footnotetag953"></a><a href="#footnote953">[953]</a>
The reports of the visitors, too,
can hardly be entirely false, though they may not be entirely true.
The charges they make are not vague, but very precise. They specify
names of the offenders, and the nature of their offences; and an air
of verisimilitude, if nothing more, is imparted to the condemnations
they pronounce against the many, by the commendations they bestow on
the few.<a id="footnotetag954" name="footnotetag954"></a><a href="#footnote954">[954]</a></p>

<p>Probably the staunchest champion of monasticism would acknowledge that
in the reign of Henry VIII. there was at least a plausible case for
mending monastic morals. But that was not then the desire of the
Government of Henry VIII.; and the case for mending their morals was
tacitly assumed to be the same as a case for ending the monasteries.
It would be unjust to Henry to deny that he had always shown himself
careful of the appearance, at least, of morality in the Church; but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page340" name="page340"></a>(p. 340)</span>
it requires a robust faith in the King's disinterestedness to
believe that dissolution was not the real object of the visitation,
and that it was merely forced upon him by the reports of the visitors.
The moral question afforded a good excuse, but the monasteries fell,
not so much because their morals were lax, as because their position
was weak. Moral laxity contributed no doubt to the general result, but
there were other causes at work. The monasteries themselves had long
been conscious that their possession of wealth was not, in the eyes of
the middle-class laity, justified by the use to which it was put; and,
for some generations at least, they had been seeking to make friends
with Mammon by giving up part of their revenues, in the form of
pensions and corrodies to courtiers, in the hope of being allowed to
retain the
remainder.<a id="footnotetag955" name="footnotetag955"></a><a href="#footnote955">[955]</a>
It had also become the custom to entrust
the stewardship of their possessions to secular hands; and, possibly
as a result, the monasteries were soon so deeply in debt to the
neighbouring gentry that their lay creditors saw no hope of recovering
their claims except by extensive
foreclosures.<a id="footnotetag956" name="footnotetag956"></a><a href="#footnote956">[956]</a>
There had
certainly been a good deal of private spoliation before the King gave
the practice a national character. The very privileges of the
monasteries were now turned to their ruin. Their immunity from
episcopal jurisdiction deprived them of episcopal aid; their exemption
from all authority, save that of the Pope, left them without support
when the papal jurisdiction was abolished. Monastic orders knew no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>(p. 341)</span>
distinction of nationality. The national character claimed
for the mediæval Church in England could scarcely cover the
monasteries, and no place was found for them in the Church when it was
given a really national garb.</p>

<p>Their dissolution is probably to be connected with Cromwell's boast
that he would make his king the richest prince in Christendom. That
was not its effect, because Henry was compelled to distribute the
greater part of the spoils among his nobles and gentry. One rash
reformer suggested that monastic lands should be devoted to
educational
purposes;<a id="footnotetag957" name="footnotetag957"></a><a href="#footnote957">[957]</a>
had that plan been followed, education in
England would have been more magnificently endowed than in any other
country of the world, and England might have become a democracy in the
seventeenth century. From this point of view Henry spoilt one of the
greatest opportunities in English history; from another, he saved
England from a most serious danger. Had the Crown retained the wealth
of the monasteries, the Stuarts might have made themselves independent
of Parliament. But this service to liberty was not voluntary on
Henry's part. The dissolution of the monasteries was in effect, and
probably in intention, a gigantic bribe to the laity to induce them to
acquiesce in the revolution effected by Henry VIII. When he was gone,
his successors might desire, or fail to prevent, a reaction; something
more permanent than Henry's iron hand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page342" name="page342"></a>(p. 342)</span>
was required to
support the fabric he had raised. That support was sought in the
wealth of the Church. The prospect had, from the very opening of the
Reformation Parliament, been dangled before the eyes of the new
nobles, the members of Parliament, the justices of the peace, the rich
merchants who thirsted for lands wherewith to make themselves
gentlemen. Chapuys again and again mentions a scheme for distributing
the lands of the Church among the laity as a project for the ensuing
session; but their time was not yet; not until their work was done
were the labourers to reap their
reward.<a id="footnotetag958" name="footnotetag958"></a><a href="#footnote958">[958]</a>
The dissolution of the
monasteries harmonised well with the secular principles of these
predominant classes. The monastic ideal of going out of the world to
seek something, which cannot be valued in terms of pounds, shillings
and pence, is abhorrent to a busy, industrial age; and every principle
is hated most at the time when it most is needed.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>Intimately associated as they were in their lives, Catherine of Aragon
and Anne Boleyn were not long divided by death; and, piteous as is the
story of the last years of Catherine, it pales before the hideous
tragedy of the ruin of Anne Boleyn. "If I have a son, as I hope
shortly, I know what will become of her," wrote Anne of the Princess
Mary.<a id="footnotetag959" name="footnotetag959"></a><a href="#footnote959">[959]</a>
On 29th January, 1536, the day of her rival's funeral, Anne
Boleyn was prematurely delivered of a dead child, and the result was
fatal to Anne herself.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page343" name="page343"></a>(p. 343)</span>
This was not her first
miscarriage,<a id="footnotetag960" name="footnotetag960"></a><a href="#footnote960">[960]</a>
and Henry's old conscience began to work again. In
Catherine's case the path of his conscience was that of a slow and
laborious pioneer; now it moved easily on its royal road to divorce.
On 29th January, Chapuys, ignorant of Anne's miscarriage, was
retailing to his master a court rumour that Henry intended to marry
again. The King was reported to have said that he had been seduced by
witchcraft when he married his second queen, and that the marriage was
null for this reason, and because God would not permit them to have
male issue.<a id="footnotetag961" name="footnotetag961"></a><a href="#footnote961">[961]</a>
There was no peace for her who supplanted her
mistress. Within six months of her marriage Henry's roving fancy had
given her cause for jealousy, and, when she complained, he is said to
have brutally told her she must put up with it as her betters had done
before.<a id="footnotetag962" name="footnotetag962"></a><a href="#footnote962">[962]</a>
These disagreements, however, were described by Chapuys
as mere lovers' quarrels, and they were generally followed by
reconciliations, after
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344"></a>(p. 344)</span>
which Anne's influence seemed as
secure as ever. But by January, 1536, the imperial ambassador and
others were counting on a fresh divorce. The rumour grew as spring
advanced, when suddenly, on 2nd May, Anne was arrested and sent to the
Tower. She was accused of incest with her brother, Lord Rochford, and
of less criminal intercourse with Sir Francis Weston, Henry Norris,
William Brereton, and Mark Smeaton. All were condemned by juries to
death for high treason on 12th May. Three days later Anne herself was
put on her trial by a panel of twenty-six peers, over which her uncle,
the Duke of Norfolk,
presided.<a id="footnotetag963" name="footnotetag963"></a><a href="#footnote963">[963]</a>
They returned a unanimous verdict
of guilty, and, on the 19th, the Queen's head was struck off with the
sword of an executioner brought for the purpose from St.
Omer.<a id="footnotetag964" name="footnotetag964"></a><a href="#footnote964">[964]</a></p>

<p>Two days before Anne's death her marriage with Henry had been declared
invalid by a court of ecclesiastical lawyers with Cranmer at its head.
The grounds of the sentence are not stated, but there may have been
two&mdash;the alleged precontract with the Earl of Northumberland, which
the Earl denied on oath and on the sacrament, and the previous
affinity between Anne and Henry arising from the King's relations with
Mary Boleyn. The latter seems the more probable. Henry had obtained of
Clement VII. a dispensation from this disability; but the Pope's
power
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page345" name="page345"></a>(p. 345)</span>
to dispense had since been repudiated, while the
canonical objection remained and was given statutory authority in this
very year.<a id="footnotetag965" name="footnotetag965"></a><a href="#footnote965">[965]</a>
The effects of this piece of wanton injustice were
among the troubles which Henry bequeathed to Queen Elizabeth; the sole
advantage to Henry was that his infidelities to Anne ceased to be
breaches of the seventh commandment. The justice of her sentence to
death is also open to doubt. Anne herself went to the block boldly
proclaiming her
innocence.<a id="footnotetag966" name="footnotetag966"></a><a href="#footnote966">[966]</a>
Death she regarded as a relief from an
intolerable situation, and she "laughed heartily," writes the
Lieutenant of the Tower as she put her hands round her "little neck,"
and thought how easy the executioner's task would
be.<a id="footnotetag967" name="footnotetag967"></a><a href="#footnote967">[967]</a> She
complained when the day of her release from this world was deferred,
and regretted that so many innocent persons should suffer through her.
Of her accomplices, none confessed but Smeaton, though Henry is said,
before Anne's arrest, to have offered Norris a pardon if he would
admit his crime. On the other hand, her conduct must have made the
charges plausible. Even in those days, when justice to individuals was
regarded as dust if weighed in the balance against the real or
supposed interests of the State, it is not credible that the juries
should have found her accomplices guilty, that twenty-six
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page346" name="page346"></a>(p. 346)</span>
peers, including her uncle, should have condemned Anne herself,
without some colourable justification. If the charges were merely
invented to ruin the Queen, one culprit besides herself would have
been enough. To assume that Henry sent four needless victims to the
block is to accuse him of a lust for superfluous butchery, of which
even he, in his most bloodthirsty moments, was not
capable.<a id="footnotetag968" name="footnotetag968"></a><a href="#footnote968">[968]</a></p>

<p>On the day that his second queen was beheaded, Henry obtained from
Cranmer a special licence to marry a
third.<a id="footnotetag969" name="footnotetag969"></a><a href="#footnote969">[969]</a>
He was betrothed on
the morrow and privately married "in the Queen's closet at York Place"
on the 30th of May. The lady of his choice was Jane, daughter of Sir
John Seymour of Wolf Hall in
Wiltshire.<a id="footnotetag970" name="footnotetag970"></a><a href="#footnote970">[970]</a>
She was descended on her
mother's side from Edward III., and Cranmer had to dispense with a
canonical bar to the marriage arising from her consanguinity to the
King in the third and fourth degrees. She had been lady-in-waiting to
the two previous queens, and her brother, Sir Edward Seymour, the
future Protector, had for years been steadily rising in Henry's
favour. In October, 1535, the King had paid a visit to Wolf Hall, and
from that time his attentions to Jane became marked. She seems to have
received them with real reluctance; she refused a purse of gold and
returned the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347"></a>(p. 347)</span>
King's letters
unopened.<a id="footnotetag971" name="footnotetag971"></a><a href="#footnote971">[971]</a>
She even obtained
a promise from Henry that he would not speak with her except in the
presence of others, and the King ejected Cromwell from his rooms in
the Palace in order to bestow them on Sir Edward Seymour, and thus to
provide a place where he and Jane could converse without scandal. All
this modesty has, of course, been attributed to prudential and
ambitious motives, which were as wise as they were successful. But
Jane seems to have had no enemies, except Alexander Aless, who
denounced her to Luther as an enemy to the Gospel, probably because
she extinguished the shining light of Anne
Boleyn.<a id="footnotetag972" name="footnotetag972"></a><a href="#footnote972">[972]</a>
Cardinal Pole
described her as "full of
goodness,"<a id="footnotetag973" name="footnotetag973"></a><a href="#footnote973">[973]</a>
and she certainly did her
best to reconcile Henry with his daughter the Princess Mary, whose
treatment began to improve from the fall of Anne Boleyn. "She is,"
writes Chapuys, "of middle stature, and no great beauty; so fair that
one would call her rather pale than
otherwise."<a id="footnotetag974" name="footnotetag974"></a><a href="#footnote974">[974]</a>
But all agreed in
praising her intelligence. She had neither Catherine's force of
character nor the temper of Anne Boleyn; she was a woman of gentle
spirit, striving always to mitigate the rigour of others; her brief
married life was probably happier than that of any other of Henry's
Queens; and her importance is mainly due to the fact that she bore to
Henry his only legitimate son.</p>

<p>The disgrace of Anne Boleyn necessitated the summons of a fresh
Parliament to put the succession to the crown on yet another basis.
The Long Parliament had been dissolved on 14th April; another was
called to meet on the 8th of June. The eighteen acts passed during its
six weeks' session
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page348" name="page348"></a>(p. 348)</span>
illustrate the parallel development of
the Reformation and of the royal autocracy. The Act of Succession made
Anne's daughter, Elizabeth, a bastard, without declaring Catherine's
daughter, Mary, legitimate, and settled the crown on Henry's
prospective issue by Jane. A unique clause empowered the King to
dispose of the crown at will, should he have no issue by his present
Queen.<a id="footnotetag975" name="footnotetag975"></a><a href="#footnote975">[975]</a>
Probably he intended it, in that case, for the Duke of
Richmond; but the Duke's days were numbered, and four days after the
dissolution of Parliament he breathed his last. The royal prerogative
was extended by a statute enabling a king, when he reached the age of
twenty-four, to repeal by proclamation any act passed during his
minority; and the royal caste was further exalted by a statute making
it high treason for any one to marry a king's daughter, legitimate or
not, his sister, his niece, or his aunt on the father's side, without
royal licence. The reform of clerical abuses was advanced by an act to
prevent non-residence, and by another to obviate the delay in
instituting to benefices practised
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page349" name="page349"></a>(p. 349)</span>
by bishops with a view to
keeping the tithes of the vacant benefice in their own hands. The
breach with Rome was widened still further by a statute, declaring all
who extolled the Pope's authority to be guilty of <i>præmunire</i>,
imposing an oath of renunciation on all lay and clerical officers, and
making the refusal of that oath high treason. Thus the hopes of a
reaction built on the fall of those "apostles of the new sect," Anne
Boleyn and her relatives, were promptly and roughly destroyed.</p>

<p>Henry's position had been immensely strengthened alike by the death of
Catherine of Aragon and by the fall of Anne Boleyn; and on both
occasions he had expressed his appreciation of the fact in the most
indecent and heartless manner. He was now free to marry whom he liked,
and no objection based on canon or on any other law could be raised to
the legitimacy of his future issue; whether the Pope could dispense or
not, it made no difference to Edward VI.'s claim to the throne. The
fall of Anne Boleyn, in spite of some few rumours that she might have
been condemned on insufficient evidence, was generally popular; for
her arrogance and that of her family made them hated, and they were
regarded as the cause of the King's persecution of Catherine, of Mary,
and of those who maintained their cause. Abroad the effect was still
more striking. The moment Henry heard of Catherine's death, he added a
postscript to Cromwell's despatch to the English ambassadors in
France, bidding them to take a higher tone with Francis, for all cause
of difference had been removed between him and Charles
V.<a id="footnotetag976" name="footnotetag976"></a><a href="#footnote976">[976]</a> The
Emperor secretly believed that his aunt had been
poisoned,<a id="footnotetag977" name="footnotetag977"></a><a href="#footnote977">[977]</a> but
that private grief was not to affect his public policy; and Charles,
Francis,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350"></a>(p. 350)</span>
and even the Pope, became more or less eager
competitors for Henry's favour. The bull of deprivation, which had
been drawn up and signed, became a dead letter, and every one was
anxious to disavow his share in its promotion. Charles obtained the
suspension of its publication, made a merit of that service to Henry,
and tried to represent that it was Francis who, with his eyes on the
English crown, had extorted the bull from the
Pope.<a id="footnotetag978" name="footnotetag978"></a><a href="#footnote978">[978]</a>
Paul III.
himself used words to the English envoy at Rome, which might be
interpreted as an apology for having made Fisher a cardinal and having
denounced his and More's
execution.<a id="footnotetag979" name="footnotetag979"></a><a href="#footnote979">[979]</a></p>

<p>Henry had been driven by fear of Charles in the previous year to make
further advances than he relished towards union with the German
princes; but the Lutherans could not be persuaded to adopt Henry's
views of the mass and of his marriage with Catherine; and now he was
glad to substitute an understanding with the Emperor for intrigues
with the Emperor's
subjects.<a id="footnotetag980" name="footnotetag980"></a><a href="#footnote980">[980]</a>
Cromwell and the council were,
indeed, a little too eager to welcome Chapuys' professions of
friendship and to entertain his demands for help against Francis.
Henry allowed them to go on for a time; but Cromwell was never in
Wolsey's position, and the King was not inclined to repeat his own and
the Cardinal's errors of 1521. He had suffered enough from the
prostration of France and the predominance of Charles; and he was
anxious now that neither should be supreme. So, when the imperial
ambassador came expecting Henry's assent, he, Cromwell and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page351" name="page351"></a>(p. 351)</span>
the rest of the council were amazed to hear the King break out into an
uncompromising defence of the French King's conduct in invading Savoy
and Piedmont.<a id="footnotetag981" name="footnotetag981"></a><a href="#footnote981">[981]</a>
That invasion was the third stroke of good fortune
which befel Henry in 1536. As Henry and Ferdinand had, in 1512,
diverted their arms from the Moors in order to make war on the Most
Christian King, so, in 1536, the Most Christian King and the
sovereign, who was at once King Catholic and the temporal head of
Christendom, instead of turning their arms against the monarch who had
outraged and defied the Church, turned them against one another.
Francis had never lost sight of Milan; he had now recovered from the
effects of Pavia; and in the spring of 1536 he overran Savoy and
Piedmont. In April the Emperor once more visited Rome, and on the 17th
he delivered a famous oration in the papal
Consistory.<a id="footnotetag982" name="footnotetag982"></a><a href="#footnote982">[982]</a>
In that
speech he denounced neither Luther nor Henry VIII.; he reserved his
invectives for Francis I. Unconsciously he demonstrated once and for
all that unity of faith was impotent against diversity of national
interests, and that, whatever deference princes might profess to the
counsels of the Vicar of Christ, the counsels they would follow would
be those of secular impulse.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>Henry was thus left to deal with the great domestic crisis of his
reign without intervention from abroad. The dissolution of the
monasteries inevitably inflicted considerable hardship on a numerous
body of men. It had been arranged that the inmates of the dissolved
religious houses should either be pensioned or transferred to other
monasteries; but, although the pensions were adequate and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page352" name="page352"></a>(p. 352)</span>
sometimes even generous in
scale,<a id="footnotetag983" name="footnotetag983"></a><a href="#footnote983">[983]</a>
and although the commissioners
themselves showed a desire to prevent unnecessary trouble by obtaining
licences for many houses to continue for a
time,<a id="footnotetag984" name="footnotetag984"></a><a href="#footnote984">[984]</a>
the monks found
some difficulty in obtaining their pensions, and Chapuys draws a
moving picture of their sufferings as they wandered about the country,
seeking employment in a market that was already overstocked with
labour, and endeavouring to earn a livelihood by means to which they
had never been
accustomed.<a id="footnotetag985" name="footnotetag985"></a><a href="#footnote985">[985]</a>
They met with no little sympathy from
the commons, who were oppressed with a like scarcity of work, and who
had looked to the monasteries for such relief as charity could afford.
Nowhere were these feelings so strong as in the north of England, and
there the commissioners for dissolving the monasteries were often met
with open resistance. Religious discontent was one of the motives for
revolt, but probably the rebels were drawn
mainly<a id="footnotetag986" name="footnotetag986"></a><a href="#footnote986">[986]</a>
from evicted
tenants, deprived of their holdings by enclosures or by the conversion
of land from tillage to pasture, men who had nothing to lose and
everything to gain by a general turmoil. In these men the wandering
monks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page353" name="page353"></a>(p. 353)</span>
found ready listeners to their complaints, and there
were others, besides the monks, who eagerly turned to account the
prevailing dissatisfaction. The northern lords, Darcy and Hussey, had
for years been representing to Chapuys the certainty of success if the
Emperor invaded England, and promising to do their part when he came.
Darcy had, at Christmas 1534, sent the imperial ambassador a sword as
an intimation that the time had come for an appeal to its arbitrament;
and he was seeking Henry's licence to return to his house in Yorkshire
in order to raise "the crucifix" as the standard of
revolt.<a id="footnotetag987" name="footnotetag987"></a><a href="#footnote987">[987]</a>
The
King, however, was doubtful of Darcy's loyalty, and kept him in London
till early in 1536. It would have been well had he kept him longer.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the summer
rumours<a id="footnotetag988" name="footnotetag988"></a><a href="#footnote988">[988]</a>
were spread among the
commons of the North that heavy taxes would be levied on every burial,
wedding and christening, that all cattle would be marked and pay a
fine to the King, and that all unmarked beasts would be forfeit;
churches within five miles of each other were to be taken down as
superfluous, jewels and church plate confiscated; taxes were to be
paid for eating white bread, goose, or capon; there was to be a rigid
inquisition into every man's property; and a score of other
absurdities gained currency, obviously invented by malicious and lying
tongues. The outbreak began at Caistor, in Lincolnshire, on the 3rd of
October, with resistance, not to the commissioners for dissolving the
monasteries, but to those appointed to collect the subsidy granted by
Parliament. The rebels entered Lincoln on the 6th; they could, they
said, pay no more money; they demanded the repeal of religious
changes,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page354" name="page354"></a>(p. 354)</span>
the restoration of the monasteries, the banishment
of heretics like Cranmer and Latimer, and the removal of low-born
advisers such as Cromwell and Rich from the
council.<a id="footnotetag989" name="footnotetag989"></a><a href="#footnote989">[989]</a>
The
mustering of an army under Suffolk and the denial by heralds and
others that the King had any such intentions as were imputed to him,
induced the commons to go home; the reserves which Henry was
collecting at Ampthill were disbanded; and the commotion was over in
less than a fortnight.</p>

<p>The Lincolnshire rebels, however, had not dispersed when news arrived
of a much more serious rising which affected nearly the whole of
Yorkshire. It was here that Darcy and his friends were most powerful;
but, though there is little doubt that they were the movers, the
ostensible leader was Robert Aske, a lawyer. Even here the rebellion
was little more than a magnified riot, which a few regiments of
soldiers could soon have suppressed. The rebels professed complete
loyalty to Henry's person; they suggested no rival candidate for the
throne; they merely demanded a change of policy, which they could not
enforce without a change of government. They had no means of effecting
that change without deposing Henry, which they never proposed to do,
and which, had they done it, could only have resulted in anarchy. The
rebellion was formidable mainly because Henry had no standing army; he
had to rely almost entirely on the goodwill or at least acquiescence
of his people. Outside Yorkshire the gentry were willing enough;
possibly they had their eyes on monastic rewards; and they sent to
Cambridge
double<a id="footnotetag990" name="footnotetag990"></a><a href="#footnote990">[990]</a>
or treble the forces Henry demanded, which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page355" name="page355"></a>(p. 355)</span>
they could hardly have done had their tenants shown any great
sympathy with the rebellion. But transport in those days was more
difficult even than now; and before the musters could reach the Trent,
Darcy, after a show of reluctance, yielded Pomfret Castle to the
rebels and swore to maintain their cause. Henry was forced, much
against his will, to temporise. To pardon or parley with rebels he
thought would distain his
honour.<a id="footnotetag991" name="footnotetag991"></a><a href="#footnote991">[991]</a>
If Norfolk was driven to offer
a pardon, he must on no account involve the King in his promise.</p>

<p>Norfolk apparently had no option. An armistice was accordingly
arranged on the 27th of October, and a deputation came up to lay the
rebels' grievances before the King. It was received graciously, and
Henry's reply was a masterly piece of
statecraft.<a id="footnotetag992" name="footnotetag992"></a><a href="#footnote992">[992]</a>
He drew it up
"with his own hand, and made no creature privy thereto until it was
finished". Their complaints about the Faith were, he said, "so general
that hard they be to be answered," but he intended always to live and
to die in the faith of Christ. They must specify what they meant by
the liberties of the Church, whether they were lawful or unlawful
liberties; but he had done nothing inconsistent with the laws of God
and man. With regard to the Commonwealth, what King had kept his
subjects so long in wealth and peace, ministering indifferent justice,
and defending them from outward enemies? There were more low-born
councillors when he came to the throne than now; then there were "but
two worth calling
noble.<a id="footnotetag993" name="footnotetag993"></a><a href="#footnote993">[993]</a>
Others, as the Lords Marny and Darcy,
were scant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page356" name="page356"></a>(p. 356)</span>
well-born gentlemen, and yet of no great lands
till they were promoted by us. The rest were lawyers and priests....
How came you to think that there were more noble men in our Privy
Council then than now?" It did not become them to dictate to their
sovereign whom he should call to his Council; yet, if they could
prove, as they alleged, that certain of the Council were subverters of
God's law and the laws of the realm, he would proceed against them.
Then, after denouncing their rebellion and referring to their request
for pardon, he says: "To show our pity, we are content, if we find you
penitent, to grant you all letters of pardon on your delivering to us
ten such ringleaders of this rebellion as we shall assign to you. Now
note the benignity of your Prince, and how easily bloodshed may be
eschewed. Thus I, as your head, pray for you, my members, that God may
enlighten you for your benefit."</p>

<p>A conference was held at Doncaster in
December,<a id="footnotetag994" name="footnotetag994"></a><a href="#footnote994">[994]</a>
and towards the
end of the year Aske came at Henry's invitation to discuss the
complaints with
him.<a id="footnotetag995" name="footnotetag995"></a><a href="#footnote995">[995]</a>
No one could be more gracious than the King,
when he chose; no one could mask his resentment more completely, when
he had an object to gain. It was important to win over Aske, and
convince him that Henry had the interests of the rebels at heart. So
on Aske were lavished
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page357" name="page357"></a>(p. 357)</span>
all the royal arts. They were amply
rewarded. In January, 1537, the rebel leader went down to Yorkshire
fully convinced of the King's goodwill, and anxious only that the
commons should observe his
conditions.<a id="footnotetag996" name="footnotetag996"></a><a href="#footnote996">[996]</a>
But there were wilder
spirits at work over which he had little control. They declared that
they were betrayed. Plots were formed to seize Hull and Scarborough;
both were
discovered.<a id="footnotetag997" name="footnotetag997"></a><a href="#footnote997">[997]</a>
Aske, Constable, and other leaders of the
original Pilgrimage of Grace exerted themselves to stay this outbreak
of their more violent followers; and between moderates and extremists
the whole movement quickly collapsed. The second revolt gave Henry an
excuse for recalling his pardon, and for exacting revenge from all who
had been implicated in either movement. Darcy deserved little pity;
the earliest in his treason, he continued the game to the end; but
Aske was an honest man, and his execution, condemned though he was by
a jury, was a violent act of
injustice.<a id="footnotetag998" name="footnotetag998"></a><a href="#footnote998">[998]</a>
Norfolk was sent to the
North on a Bloody
Assize,<a id="footnotetag999" name="footnotetag999"></a><a href="#footnote999">[999]</a>
and if neither he nor the King was a
Jeffreys, the rebellion was stamped out with a good deal of
superfluous cruelty. Henry was resolved to do the work once and for
all, and he based his system on terror. His measures for the future
government of the North, now threatened by James V., were, however,
wise on the whole. He would put no more nobles in places of trust; the
office of Warden of the Marches he took into his own hands, appointing
three deputies of somewhat humble rank for the east, middle and west
marches.<a id="footnotetag1000" name="footnotetag1000"></a><a href="#footnote1000">[1000]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page358" name="page358"></a>(p. 358)</span>
A strong Council of the North was appointed
to sit at York, under the presidency of Tunstall, Bishop of Durham,
and with powers almost as extensive as those of the Privy Council at
London; and henceforth Henry had little trouble from disaffection in
England.<a id="footnotetag1001" name="footnotetag1001"></a><a href="#footnote1001">[1001]</a></p>

<p>With one aftermath of the Pilgrimage of Grace he had yet to deal. The
opportunity had been too good for Paul III. to neglect; and early in
1537 he had sent a legate <i>a latere</i> to Flanders to do what he could
to abet the
rebellion.<a id="footnotetag1002" name="footnotetag1002"></a><a href="#footnote1002">[1002]</a>
His choice fell on Reginald Pole, the son
of the Countess of Salisbury and grandson of George, Duke of Clarence.
Pole had been one of Henry's great favourites; the King had paid for
his education, given him, while yet a layman, rich church preferments,
and contributed the equivalent of about twelve hundred pounds a year
to enable him to complete his studies in
Italy.<a id="footnotetag1003" name="footnotetag1003"></a><a href="#footnote1003">[1003]</a>
In 1530 Pole was
employed to obtain opinions at Paris favourable to Henry's
divorce,<a id="footnotetag1004" name="footnotetag1004"></a><a href="#footnote1004">[1004]</a>
and was offered the Archbishopric of York. He refused
from conscientious
scruples,<a id="footnotetag1005" name="footnotetag1005"></a><a href="#footnote1005">[1005]</a>
sought in vain to turn the King
from his evil ways, and, in 1532, left England; they parted friends,
and Henry continued Pole's pensions. While Pole was regarding with
increasing disgust the King's actions, Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page359" name="page359"></a>(p. 359)</span>
still hoped
that Pole was on his side, and, in 1536, in answer to Henry's request
for his views, Pole sent his famous treatise <i>De Unitate Ecclesiæ</i>.
His heart was better than his head; he thought Henry had been treated
too gently, and that the fulmination of a bull of excommunication
earlier in his course would have stopped his headlong career. To
repair the Pope's omissions, Pole now proceeded to administer the
necessary castigation; "flattery," he said, "had been the cause of all
the evil". Even his friend, Cardinal Contarini, thought the book too
bitter, and among his family in England it produced
consternation.<a id="footnotetag1006" name="footnotetag1006"></a><a href="#footnote1006">[1006]</a>
Some of them were hand in glove with Chapuys, who
had suggested Pole to Charles as a candidate for the throne; and his
book might well have broken the thin ice on which they stood. Henry,
however, suppressed his anger and invited Pole to England; he, perhaps
wisely, refused, but immediately afterwards he accepted the Pope's
call to Rome, where he was made
cardinal,<a id="footnotetag1007" name="footnotetag1007"></a><a href="#footnote1007">[1007]</a>
and sent to Flanders
as legate to foment the northern rebellion.</p>

<p>He came too late to do anything except exhibit his own and the papal
impotence. The rebellion was crushed before his commission was signed.
As Pole journeyed through France, Henry sent to demand his extradition
as a
traitor.<a id="footnotetag1008" name="footnotetag1008"></a><a href="#footnote1008">[1008]</a>
With that request Francis could hardly comply, but
he ordered the legate to quit his dominions. Pole sought refuge in
Flanders, but was stopped on the frontier. Charles could no more than
Francis afford to offend the English King, and the cardinal-legate was
informed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page360" name="page360"></a>(p. 360)</span>
that he might visit the Bishop of Liège, but only
if he went in
disguise.<a id="footnotetag1009" name="footnotetag1009"></a><a href="#footnote1009">[1009]</a>
Never, wrote Pole to the Regent, had a
papal legate been so treated before. Truly Henry had fulfilled his
boast that he would show the princes of Europe how small was the power
of a Pope. He had obliterated every vestige of papal authority in
England and defied the Pope to do his worst; and now, when the Pope
attempted to do it, his legate was chased out of the dominions of the
faithful sons of the Church at the demand of the excommunicate King.
Henry had come triumphant out of perils which every one else believed
would destroy him. He had carried England through the greatest
revolution in her history. He had crushed the only revolt which that
revolution evoked at home; and abroad the greatest princes of Europe
had shown that they valued as nothing the goodwill of the Pope against
that of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>The culminating point in his good fortune was reached in the following
autumn. On the 12th of October, 1537, Queen Jane gave birth to a son.
Henry had determined that, had he a son by Anne Boleyn, the child
should be named Henry after himself, or Edward after his grandfather,
Edward IV. Queen Jane's son was born on the eve of the feast of St.
Edward, and that fact decided the choice of his name. Twelve days
later the mother, who had never been crowned, passed
away.<a id="footnotetag1010" name="footnotetag1010"></a><a href="#footnote1010">[1010]</a>
She,
alone of Henry's wives, was buried with royal pomp in St. George's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page361" name="page361"></a>(p. 361)</span>
Chapel at Windsor; and to her alone the King paid the
compliment of mourning. His grief was sincere, and for the unusual
space of more than two years he remained without a wife. But Queen
Jane's death was not to be compared in importance with the birth of
Edward VI. The legitimate male heir, the object of so many desires and
the cause of so many tragedies, had come at last to fill to the brim
the cup of Henry's triumph. The greatest storm and stress of his reign
was passed. There were crises to come, which might have been deemed
serious in a less troubled reign, and they still needed all Henry's
wary cunning to meet; Francis and Charles were even now preparing to
end a struggle from which only Henry drew profit; and Paul was hoping
to join them in war upon England. Yet Henry had weathered the worst of
the gale, and he now felt free to devote his energies to the extension
abroad of the authority which he had established so firmly at home.</p>






<h3>CHAPTER XIV.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page362" name="page362"></a>(p. 362)</span>
</h3>

<h4>REX ET IMPERATOR.</h4>


<p>Notwithstanding the absence of "Empire" and "Emperor" from the various
titles which Henry VIII. possessed or assumed, he has more than one
claim to be reputed the father of modern imperialism. It is not till a
year after his death that we have any documentary evidence of an
intention on the part of the English Government to unite England and
Scotland into one Empire, and to proclaim their sovereign the Emperor
of Great
Britain.<a id="footnotetag1011" name="footnotetag1011"></a><a href="#footnote1011">[1011]</a>
But a marriage between Edward VI. and Mary,
Queen of Scots, by which it was sought to effect that union, had been
the main object of Henry's efforts during the closing years of his
reign, and the imperial idea was a dominant note in Henry's mind. No
king was more fond of protesting that he wore an imperial crown and
ruled an imperial realm. When, in 1536, Convocation declared England
to be "an imperial See of itself," it only clothed in decent and
formal language Henry's own boast that he was not merely King, but
Pope and Emperor, in his own domains. The rest of Western Europe was
under the temporal sway of Cæsar, as it was under the spiritual sway
of the Pope; but neither to one nor to the other did Henry owe any
allegiance.<a id="footnotetag1012" name="footnotetag1012"></a><a href="#footnote1012">[1012]</a></p>

<p>For
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page363" name="page363"></a>(p. 363)</span>
the word "imperial" itself he had shown a marked
predilection from his earliest days. <i>Henry Imperial</i> was the name of
the ship in which his admiral hoisted his flag in 1513, and "Imperial"
was the name given to one of his favourite games. But, as his reign
wore on, the word was translated into action, and received a more
definite meaning. To mark his claim to supreme dignity, he assumed the
style of "His Majesty" instead of that of "His Grace," which he had
hitherto shared with mere dukes and archbishops; and possibly "His
Majesty" banished "His Grace" from Henry's mind no less than it did
from his title. The story of his life is one of consistent, and more
or less orderly, evolution. For many years he had been kept in
leading-strings by Wolsey's and other clerical influences. The first
step in his self-assertion was to emancipate himself from this
control, and to vindicate his authority within the precincts of his
Court. His next was to establish his personal supremacy over Church
and State in England; this was the work of the Reformation Parliament
between 1529 and 1536. The final
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page364" name="page364"></a>(p. 364)</span>
stage in the evolution was
to make his rule more effective in the outlying parts of England, on
the borders of Scotland, in Wales and its Marches, and then to extend
it over the rest of the British Isles.</p>

<p>The initial steps in the process of expanding the sphere of royal
authority had already been taken. The condition of Wales exercised the
mind of King and Parliament, even in the throes of the struggle with
Rome.<a id="footnotetag1013" name="footnotetag1013"></a><a href="#footnote1013">[1013]</a>
The "manifold robberies, murders, thefts, trespasses,
riots, routs, embraceries, maintenances, oppressions, ruptures of the
peace, and many other malefacts, which be there daily practised,
perpetrated, committed and done," obviously demanded prompt and swift
redress, unless the redundant eloquence of parliamentary statutes
protested too much; and, in 1534, several acts were passed restraining
local jurisdictions, and extending the authority of the President and
Council of the
Marches.<a id="footnotetag1014" name="footnotetag1014"></a><a href="#footnote1014">[1014]</a>
Chapuys declared that the effect of
these acts was to rob the Welsh of their freedom, and he thought that
the probable discontent might be turned to account by stirring an
insurrection in favour of Catherine of Aragon and of the Catholic
faith.<a id="footnotetag1015" name="footnotetag1015"></a><a href="#footnote1015">[1015]</a>
If, however, there was discontent, it did
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page365" name="page365"></a>(p. 365)</span>
not
make itself effectively felt, and, in 1536, Henry proceeded to
complete the union of England and Wales. First, he adapted to Wales
the institution of justices of the peace, which had proved the most
efficient instrument for the maintenance of his authority in England.
A more important statute followed. Recalling the facts that "the
rights, usages, laws and customs" in Wales "be far discrepant from the
laws and customs of this realm," that its people "do daily use a
speech nothing like, nor consonant to, the natural mother-tongue used
within this realm," and that "some rude and ignorant people have made
distinction and diversity between the King's subjects of this realm"
and those of Wales, "His Highness, of a singular zeal, love and
favour" which he bore to the Welsh, minded to reduce them "to the
perfect order, notice and knowledge of his laws of this realm, and
utterly to extirp, all and singular, the sinister usages and customs
differing from the same". The Principality was divided into shires,
and the shires into hundreds; justice in every court, from the highest
to the lowest, was to be administered in English, and in no other
tongue; and no one who spoke Welsh was to "have or enjoy any manner of
Office or Fees" whatsoever. On the other hand, a royal commission was
appointed to inquire into Welsh laws, and such as the King thought
necessary might still be observed; while the Welsh shires and boroughs
were to send members to the English Parliament. This statute was, to
all effects and purposes, the first Act of Union in English history.
Six years later a further act reorganised and developed the
jurisdiction of the Council of Wales and the Marches. Its functions
were to be similar to those of the Privy Council in London,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page366" name="page366"></a>(p. 366)</span>
of which the Council of Wales, like that of the already established
Council of the North, was an offshoot. Its object was to maintain
peace with a firm hand in a specially disorderly district; and the
powers, with which it was furnished, often conflicted with the common
law of
England,<a id="footnotetag1016" name="footnotetag1016"></a><a href="#footnote1016">[1016]</a>
and rendered the Council's jurisdiction, like
that of other Tudor courts, a grievance to Stuart Parliaments.</p>

<p>But Ireland demanded even more than Wales the application of Henry's
doctrines of union and empire; for if Wales was thought by Chapuys to
be receptive soil for the seeds of rebellion, sedition across St.
George's Channel was ripe unto the harvest. Irish affairs, among other
domestic problems, had been sacrificed to Wolsey's passion for playing
a part in Europe, and on the eve of his fall English rule in Ireland
was reported to be weaker than it had been since the Conquest. The
outbreak of war with Charles V., in 1528, was followed by the first
appearance of Spanish emissaries at the courts of Irish chiefs, and
from Spanish intrigue in Ireland Tudor monarchs were never again to be
free. In the autumn of 1534 the whole of Ireland outside the pale
blazed up in revolt. Sir William Skeffington succeeded in crushing the
rebellion; but Skeffington died in the following year, and his
successor, Lord Leonard Grey, failed to overcome the difficulties
caused by Irish disaffection and by jealousies in his council. His
sister was wife of Fitzgerald, the Earl
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page367" name="page367"></a>(p. 367)</span>
of Kildare, and the
revolt of the Geraldines brought Grey himself under suspicion. He was
accused by his council of treason; he returned to England in 1540,
declaring the country at peace. But, before he had audience with
Henry, a fresh insurrection broke out, and Grey was sent to the Tower;
thence, having pleaded guilty to charges of treason, he trod the usual
path to the block.</p>

<p>Henry now adopted fresh methods; he determined to treat Ireland in
much the same way as Wales. A commission, appointed in 1537, had made
a thorough survey of the land, and supplied him with the outlines of
his policy. As in Wales, the English system of land tenure, of justice
and the English language were to supersede indigenous growths; the
King's supremacy in temporal and ecclesiastical affairs was to be
enforced, and the whole of the land was to be gradually won by a
judicious admixture of force and
conciliation.<a id="footnotetag1017" name="footnotetag1017"></a><a href="#footnote1017">[1017]</a>
The new deputy,
Sir Anthony St. Leger, was an able man, who had presided over the
commission of 1537. He landed at Dublin in 1541, and his work was
thoroughly done. Henry, no longer so lavish with his money as in
Wolsey's days, did not stint for this
purpose.<a id="footnotetag1018" name="footnotetag1018"></a><a href="#footnote1018">[1018]</a>
The Irish
Parliament passed an act that Henry should be henceforth styled King,
instead of Lord, of Ireland; and many of the chiefs were induced to
relinquish their tribal independence in return for glittering
coronets. By 1542 Ireland had not merely peace within her own borders,
but was able to send two thousand kernes to assist the English on the
borders of Scotland; and English rule in Ireland was more widely and
more firmly established than it had ever been before.</p>

<p>Besides
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page368" name="page368"></a>(p. 368)</span>
Ireland and Wales, there were other spheres in which
Henry sought to consolidate and extend the Tudor methods of
government. The erection, in 1542, of the Courts of Wards and
Liveries, of First-fruits and Tenths, and the development of the
jurisdiction of the Star Chamber and of the Court of
Requests,<a id="footnotetag1019" name="footnotetag1019"></a><a href="#footnote1019">[1019]</a>
were all designed to further two objects dear to Henry's heart, the
efficiency of his administration and the exaltation of his
prerogative. It was thoroughly in keeping with his policy that the
parliamentary system expanded concurrently with the sphere of the
King's activity. Berwick had first been represented in the Parliament
of 1529,<a id="footnotetag1020" name="footnotetag1020"></a><a href="#footnote1020">[1020]</a>
and a step, which would have led to momentous
consequences, had the idea, on which it was based, been carried out,
was taken in 1536, when two members were summoned from Calais. There
was now only one district under English rule which was not represented
in Parliament, and that was the county of Durham, known as <i>the</i>
bishopric, which still remained detached from the national system. It
was left for Oliver Cromwell to complete England's parliamentary
representation by summoning members to sit for that palatine
county.<a id="footnotetag1021" name="footnotetag1021"></a><a href="#footnote1021">[1021]</a>
This was not the only respect in which the Commonwealth
followed in the footsteps of Henry VIII., for the Parliament of 1542,
in which members from Wales and from Calais are first recorded as
sitting,<a id="footnotetag1022" name="footnotetag1022"></a><a href="#footnote1022">[1022]</a>
passed an "Act
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page369" name="page369"></a>(p. 369)</span>
for the Navy," which provided
that goods could only be imported in English ships. It was, however,
in his dealings with Scotland that Henry's schemes for the expansion
of England became most marked; but, before he could develop his plans
in that direction, he had to ward off a recrudescence of the danger
from a coalition of Catholic Europe.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>In spite of Henry's efforts to fan the flames of
strife<a id="footnotetag1023" name="footnotetag1023"></a><a href="#footnote1023">[1023]</a>
between
the Emperor and the King of France, the war, which had prevented
either monarch from countenancing the mission of Cardinal Pole or from
profiting by the Pilgrimage of Grace, was gradually dying down in the
autumn of 1537; and, in order to check the growing and dangerous
intimacy between the two rivals, Henry was secretly hinting to both
that the death of his Queen had left him free to contract a marriage
which might bind him for ever to one or the
other.<a id="footnotetag1024" name="footnotetag1024"></a><a href="#footnote1024">[1024]</a>
To Francis he
sent a request for the hand of Mary of Guise, who had already been
promised to James V. of Scotland. He refused to believe that the Scots
negotiations had proceeded so far that they could not be set aside for
so great a king as himself, and he succeeded in convincing the lady's
relatives that the position of a Queen of England provided greater
attractions than any James could hold
out.<a id="footnotetag1025" name="footnotetag1025"></a><a href="#footnote1025">[1025]</a>
Francis, however,
took matters into his own hands, and compelled the Guises to fulfil
their compact with the Scottish King. Nothing daunted, Henry asked for
a list of other French ladies eligible for the matrimonial prize.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page370" name="page370"></a>(p. 370)</span>
He even suggested that the handsomest of them might be sent, in
the train of Margaret of Navarre, to Calais, where he could inspect
them in
person.<a id="footnotetag1026" name="footnotetag1026"></a><a href="#footnote1026">[1026]</a>
"I trust to no one," he told Castillon, the
French ambassador, "but myself. The thing touches me too near. I wish
to see them and know them some time before
deciding."<a id="footnotetag1027" name="footnotetag1027"></a><a href="#footnote1027">[1027]</a>
This idea
of "trotting out the young ladies like
hackneys"<a id="footnotetag1028" name="footnotetag1028"></a><a href="#footnote1028">[1028]</a>
was not much
relished at the French Court; and Castillon, to shame Henry out of the
indelicacy of his proposal, made an ironical suggestion for testing
the ladies' charms, the grossness of which brought the only recorded
blush to Henry's
cheeks.<a id="footnotetag1029" name="footnotetag1029"></a><a href="#footnote1029">[1029]</a>
No more was said of the beauty-show;
and Henry declared that he did not intend to marry in France or in
Spain at all, unless his marriage brought him a closer alliance with
Francis or Charles than the rivals had formed with each other.</p>

<p>While these negotiations for obtaining the hand of a French princess
were in progress, Henry set on foot a similar quest in the
Netherlands. Before the end of 1537 he had instructed Hutton, his
agent, to report on the ladies of the Regent Mary's
Court;<a id="footnotetag1030" name="footnotetag1030"></a><a href="#footnote1030">[1030]</a>
and
Hutton replied that Christina of Milan was said to be "a goodly
personage and of excellent beauty". She was daughter of the deposed
King of Denmark and of his wife, Isabella, sister of Charles V.; at
the age of thirteen she had been married
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page371" name="page371"></a>(p. 371)</span>
to the Duke of
Milan, but she was now a virgin widow of sixteen, "very tall and
competent of beauty, of favour excellent and very gentle in
countenance".<a id="footnotetag1031" name="footnotetag1031"></a><a href="#footnote1031">[1031]</a>
On 10th March, 1538, Holbein arrived at Brussels
for the purpose of painting the lady's portrait, which he finished in
a three hours'
sitting.<a id="footnotetag1032" name="footnotetag1032"></a><a href="#footnote1032">[1032]</a>
Christina's fascinations do not seem to
have made much impression on Henry; indeed, his taste in feminine
beauty cannot be commended. There is no good authority for the alleged
reply of the young duchess herself, that, if she had two heads, she
would willingly place one of them at His Majesty's
disposal.<a id="footnotetag1033" name="footnotetag1033"></a><a href="#footnote1033">[1033]</a>
Henry had, as yet, beheaded only one of his wives, and even if the
precedent had been more firmly established, Christina was too wary and
too polite to refer to it in such uncourtly terms. She knew that the
disposal of her hand did not rest with herself, and though the Emperor
sent powers for the conclusion of the match, neither he nor Henry had
any desire to see it concluded. The cementing of his friendship with
Francis freed Charles from the need of Henry's goodwill, and impelled
the English King to seek elsewhere for means to counter-balance the
hostile alliance.</p>

<p>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page372" name="page372"></a>(p. 372)</span>
Emperor and the French King had not been deluded by
English intrigues, nor prevented from coming together by Henry's
desire to keep them apart. Charles, Francis, and Paul III. met at Nice
in June, 1538, and there the Pope negotiated a ten years' truce.
Henceforth they were to consider their interests identical, and their
ambassadors in England compared notes in order to defeat more
effectively Henry's skilful
diplomacy.<a id="footnotetag1034" name="footnotetag1034"></a><a href="#footnote1034">[1034]</a>
The moment seemed ripe
for the execution of the long-cherished project for a descent upon
England. Its King had just added to his long list of offences against
the Church by despoiling the shrine of St. Thomas at Canterbury and
burning the bones of the saint. The saint was even said to have been
put on his trial in mockery, declared contumacious, and condemned as a
traitor.<a id="footnotetag1035" name="footnotetag1035"></a><a href="#footnote1035">[1035]</a>
If the canonised bones of martyrs could be treated
thus, who would, for the future, pay respect to the Church or tribute
at its shrines? At Rome a party, of which Pole was the most zealous,
proclaimed that the real Turk was Henry, and that all Christian
princes should unite to sweep him from the face of God's earth, which
his presence had too long defiled. Considering the effect of Christian
leagues against the Ottoman, the English Turk was probably not
dismayed. But Paul III. and Pole were determined to do their worst.
The Pope resolved to publish the bull of deprivation, which had been
drawn up in August, 1535, though its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page373" name="page373"></a>(p. 373)</span>
execution had hitherto
been suspended owing to papal hopes of Henry's amendment and to the
request of various princes. Now the bull was to be published in
France, in Flanders, in Scotland and in Ireland. Beton was made a
cardinal and sent home to exhort James V. to invade his uncle's
kingdom,<a id="footnotetag1036" name="footnotetag1036"></a><a href="#footnote1036">[1036]</a>
while Pole again set out on his travels to promote the
conquest of his native
land.<a id="footnotetag1037" name="footnotetag1037"></a><a href="#footnote1037">[1037]</a></p>

<p>It was on Pole's unfortunate relatives that the effects of the
threatened bull were to fall. Besides the Cardinal's treason, there
was another motive for proscribing his family. He and his brothers
were grandchildren of George, Duke of Clarence; years before, Chapuys
had urged Charles V. to put forward Pole as a candidate for the
throne; and Henry was as convinced as his father had been that the
real way to render his Government secure was to put away all the
possible alternatives. Now that he was threatened with deprivation by
papal sentence, the need became more urgent than ever. But, while the
proscription of the Poles was undoubtedly dictated by political
reasons, their conduct enabled Henry to effect it by legal means.
There was no doubt of the Cardinal's treason; his brother, Sir
Geoffrey, had often taken counsel with Charles's ambassador, and
discussed plans for the invasion of
England;<a id="footnotetag1038" name="footnotetag1038"></a><a href="#footnote1038">[1038]</a>
and even their
mother, the aged Countess of Salisbury, although she had denounced the
Cardinal as a traitor and had lamented the fact that she had given him
birth, had brought herself within the toils by receiving papal bulls
and corresponding with
traitors.<a id="footnotetag1039" name="footnotetag1039"></a><a href="#footnote1039">[1039]</a>
The least guilty of the family
appears to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page374" name="page374"></a>(p. 374)</span>
have been the Countess's eldest son, Lord
Montague;<a id="footnotetag1040" name="footnotetag1040"></a><a href="#footnote1040">[1040]</a>
but he, too, was involved in the common ruin. Plots
were hatched for kidnapping the Cardinal and bringing him home to
stand his trial for treason. Sir Geoffrey was arrested in August,
1538, was induced, or forced, to turn King's evidence, and as a reward
was granted his miserable, conscience-struck
life.<a id="footnotetag1041" name="footnotetag1041"></a><a href="#footnote1041">[1041]</a>
The Countess
was spared for a while, but Montague mounted the scaffold in December.</p>

<p>With Montague perished his cousin, the Marquis of Exeter, whose
descent from Edward IV. was as fatal to him as their descent from
Clarence was to the Poles. The Marquis was the White Rose, the next
heir to the throne if the line of the Tudors failed. His father, the
Earl of Devonshire, had been attainted in the reign of Henry VII.; but
Henry VIII. had reversed the attainder, had treated the young Earl
with kindness, had made him Knight of the Garter and Marquis of
Exeter, and had sought in various ways to win his support. But his
dynastic position and dislike of Henry's policy drove the Marquis into
the ranks of the discontented. He had been put in the Tower, in 1531,
on suspicion of treason; after his release he listened to the
hysterics of Elizabeth Barton, intrigued with Chapuys, and
corresponded with Reginald
Pole;<a id="footnotetag1042" name="footnotetag1042"></a><a href="#footnote1042">[1042]</a>
and in Cornwall, in 1538, men
conspired to make him
King.<a id="footnotetag1043" name="footnotetag1043"></a><a href="#footnote1043">[1043]</a>
Less evidence than this would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page375" name="page375"></a>(p. 375)</span>
have convinced a jury of peers in Tudor times of the expediency
of Exeter's death; and, on the 9th of December, his head paid the
price of his royal descent.</p>

<p>These executions do not seem to have produced the faintest symptoms of
disgust in the popular mind. The threat of invasion evoked a national
enthusiasm for defence. In August, 1538, Henry went down to inspect
the fortifications he had been for years erecting at Dover; masonry
from the demolished monasteries was employed in dotting the coast with
castles, such as Calshot and Hurst, which were built with materials
from the neighbouring abbey of Beaulieu. Commissioners were sent to
repair the defences at Calais and Guisnes, on the Scottish Borders,
along the coasts from Berwick to the mouth of the Thames, and from the
Thames to Lizard
Point.<a id="footnotetag1044" name="footnotetag1044"></a><a href="#footnote1044">[1044]</a>
Beacons were repaired, ordnance was
supplied wherever it was needed, lists of ships and of mariners were
drawn up in every port, and musters were taken throughout the kingdom.
Everywhere the people pressed forward to help; in the Isle of Wight
they were lining the shores with palisades, and taking every
precaution to render a landing of the enemy a perilous
enterprise.<a id="footnotetag1045" name="footnotetag1045"></a><a href="#footnote1045">[1045]</a>
In Essex they anticipated the coming of the
commissioners by digging dykes and throwing up ramparts; at Harwich
the Lord Chancellor saw "women and children working with shovels at
the trenches and bulwarks". Whatever we may think of the roughness and
rigour of Henry's rule, his methods were not resented by the mass of
his people. He had not lost his hold on the nation; whenever he
appealed to his subjects in a time of national danger,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page376" name="page376"></a>(p. 376)</span>
he
met with an eager response; and, had the schemers abroad, who idly
dreamt of his expulsion from the throne, succeeded in composing their
mutual quarrels and launching their bolt against England, there is no
reason to suppose that its fate would have differed from that of the
Spanish Armada.</p>

<p>In spite of the fears of invasion which prevailed in the spring of
1539, Pole's second mission had no more success than the
first;<a id="footnotetag1046" name="footnotetag1046"></a><a href="#footnote1046">[1046]</a>
and the hostile fleet, for the sight of which the Warden of the Cinque
Ports was straining his eyes from Dover Castle, never came from the
mouths of the Scheldt and the Rhine; or rather, the supposed Armada
proved to be a harmless convoy of
traders.<a id="footnotetag1047" name="footnotetag1047"></a><a href="#footnote1047">[1047]</a>
The Pope himself, on
second thoughts, withheld his promised bull. He distrusted its
reception at the hands of his secular allies, and dreaded the contempt
and ridicule which would follow an open
failure.<a id="footnotetag1048" name="footnotetag1048"></a><a href="#footnote1048">[1048]</a>
Moreover, at
the height of his fervour against Henry, he could not refrain from
attempts to extend his temporal power, and his seizure of Urbino
alienated Francis and afforded Henry some prospect of creating an
anti-papal party in
Italy.<a id="footnotetag1049" name="footnotetag1049"></a><a href="#footnote1049">[1049]</a>
Francis would gladly join in a
prohibition of English commerce, if Charles would only begin; but
without Charles he could do nothing, and, even when his amity with the
Emperor was closest, he was compelled, at Henry's demand, to punish
the French priests who inveighed against English
enormities.<a id="footnotetag1050" name="footnotetag1050"></a><a href="#footnote1050">[1050]</a>
To Charles,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page377" name="page377"></a>(p. 377)</span>
however, English trade was worth more than to
Francis, and the Emperor's subjects would tolerate no interruption of
their lucrative intercourse with England. With the consummate skill
which he almost invariably displayed in political matters, Henry had,
in 1539, when the danger seemed greatest, provided the Flemings with
an additional motive for peace. He issued a proclamation that, for
seven years, their goods should pay no more duty than those of the
English
themselves;<a id="footnotetag1051" name="footnotetag1051"></a><a href="#footnote1051">[1051]</a>
and the thrifty Dutch were little inclined
to stop, by a war, the fresh stream of gold. The Emperor, too, had
more urgent matters in hand. Henry might be more of a Turk than the
Sultan himself, and the Pope might regard the sack of St. Thomas's
shrine with more horror than the Turkish defeat of a Christian fleet;
but Henry was not harrying the Emperor's coasts, nor threatening to
deprive the Emperor's brother of his Hungarian kingdom; and Turkish
victories on land and on sea gave the imperial family much more
concern than all Henry's onslaughts on the saints and their relics.
And, besides the Ottoman peril, Charles had reason to fear the
political effects of the union between England and the Protestant
princes of Germany, for which the religious development in England was
paving the way, and which an attack on Henry would at once have
cemented.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>The powers conferred upon Henry as Supreme Head of the Church were not
long suffered to remain in abeyance. Whatever the theory may have
been, in practice Henry's supremacy over the Church was very different
from that which Kings of England had hitherto wielded; and from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page378" name="page378"></a>(p. 378)</span>
moment he entered upon his new ecclesiastical kingdom, he set
himself not merely to reform practical abuses, such as the excessive
wealth of the clergy, but to define the standard of orthodox faith,
and to force his subjects to embrace the royal theology. The Catholic
faith was to hold good only so far as the Supreme Head willed; the
"King's doctrine" became the rule to which "<i>our</i> Church of England,"
as Henry styled it, was henceforth to conform; and "unity and concord
in opinion" were to be established by royal decree.</p>

<p>The first royal definition of the faith was embodied in ten articles
submitted to Convocation in 1536. The King was, he said, constrained
by diversity of opinions "to put his own pen to the book and conceive
certain articles... thinking that no person, having authority from
him, would presume to say a word against their meaning, or be remiss
in setting them
forth".<a id="footnotetag1052" name="footnotetag1052"></a><a href="#footnote1052">[1052]</a>
His people, he maintained, whether peer
or prelate, had no right to resist his temporal or spiritual commands,
whatever they might be. Episcopal authority had indeed sunk low. When
Convocation was opened, in 1536, a layman, Dr. William Petre,
appeared, and demanded the place of honour above all bishops and
archbishops in their assembly. Pre-eminence belonged, he said, to the
King as Supreme Head of the Church; the King had appointed Cromwell
his Vicar-general; and Cromwell had named him, Petre, his
proctor.<a id="footnotetag1053" name="footnotetag1053"></a><a href="#footnote1053">[1053]</a>
The claim was allowed, and the submissive clergy found
little fault with the royal articles of faith, though they mentioned
only three sacraments, baptism, penance and the sacrament of the
altar, denounced the abuse
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page379" name="page379"></a>(p. 379)</span>
of images, warned men against
excessive devotion to the saints, and against believing that
"ceremonies have power to remit sin," or that masses can deliver souls
from purgatory. Finally, Convocation transferred from the Pope to the
Christian princes the right to summon a General
Council.<a id="footnotetag1054" name="footnotetag1054"></a><a href="#footnote1054">[1054]</a></p>

<p>With the <i>Institution of a Christian Man</i>, issued in the following
year, and commonly called <i>The Bishops' Book</i>, Henry had little to do.
The bishops debated the doctrinal questions from February to July,
1537, but the King wrote, in August, that he had had no time to
examine their
conclusions.<a id="footnotetag1055" name="footnotetag1055"></a><a href="#footnote1055">[1055]</a>
He trusted, however, to their wisdom,
and agreed that the book should be published and read to the people on
Sundays and holy-days for three years to come. In the same year he
permitted a change, which inevitably gave fresh impulse to the
reforming movement in England and destroyed every prospect of that
"union and concord in opinions," on which he set so much store. Miles
Coverdale was licensed to print an edition of his Bible in England,
with a dedication to Queen Jane Seymour; and, in 1538, a second
English version was prepared by John Rogers, under Cranmer's
authority, and published as Matthew's
Bible.<a id="footnotetag1056" name="footnotetag1056"></a><a href="#footnote1056">[1056]</a>
This was the Bible
"of the largest volume" which Cromwell, as Henry's Vicegerent, ordered
to be set up in all churches. Every incumbent was to encourage his
parishioners to read it; he was to recite the Paternoster, the Creed
and the Ten Commandments in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page380" name="page380"></a>(p. 380)</span>
English, that his flock might
learn them by degrees; he was to require some acquaintance with the
rudiments of the faith, as a necessary condition from all before they
could receive the Sacrament of the Altar; he was to preach at least
once a quarter; and to institute a register of births, marriages and
deaths.<a id="footnotetag1057" name="footnotetag1057"></a><a href="#footnote1057">[1057]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, a vigorous assault was made on the strongholds of
superstition; pilgrimages were suppressed, and many wonder-working
images were pulled down and destroyed. The famous Rood of Boxley, a
figure whose contortions had once imposed on the people, was taken to
the market-place at
Maidstone,<a id="footnotetag1058" name="footnotetag1058"></a><a href="#footnote1058">[1058]</a>
and the ingenious mechanism,
whereby the eyes and lips miraculously opened and shut, was exhibited
to the vulgar
gaze.<a id="footnotetag1059" name="footnotetag1059"></a><a href="#footnote1059">[1059]</a>
Probably these little devices had already
sunk in popular esteem, for the Blood of St. Januarius could not be
treated at Naples to-day in the same cavalier fashion as the Blood of
Hailes was in England in
1538,<a id="footnotetag1060" name="footnotetag1060"></a><a href="#footnote1060">[1060]</a>
without a riot. But the exposure
was a useful method of exciting popular indignation against the monks,
and it filled reformers with a holy joy. "Dagon," wrote one to
Bullinger, "is everywhere falling in England. Bel of Babylon has been
broken to
pieces."<a id="footnotetag1061" name="footnotetag1061"></a><a href="#footnote1061">[1061]</a>
The destruction of the images was a
preliminary skirmish in the final campaign
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page381" name="page381"></a>(p. 381)</span>
against the
monks. The Act of 1536 had only granted to the King religious houses
which possessed an endowment of less than two hundred pounds a year;
the dissolution of the greater monasteries was now gradually effected
by a process of more or less voluntary surrender. In some cases the
monks may have been willing enough to go; they were loaded with debt,
and harassed by rules imposed by Cromwell, which would have been
difficult to keep in the palmiest days of monastic enthusiasm; and
they may well have thought that freedom from monastic restraint,
coupled with a pension, was a welcome relief, especially when
resistance involved the anger of the prince and liability to the
penalties of elastic treasons and of a <i>præmunire</i> which no one could
understand. So, one after another, the great abbeys yielded to the
persuasions and threats of the royal commissioners. The dissolution of
the Mendicant Orders and of the Knights of St. John dispersed the last
remnants of the papal army as an organised force in England, though
warfare of a kind continued for many years.</p>

<p>These proceedings created as much satisfaction among the Lutherans of
Germany as they did disgust at Rome, and an alliance between Henry and
the Protestant princes seemed to be dictated by a community of
religious, as well as of political, interests. The friendship between
Francis and Charles threatened both English and German liberties, and
it behoved the two countries to combine against their common foe.
Henry's manifesto against the authority of the Pope to summon a
General Council had been received with rapture in Germany; at least
three German editions were printed, and the Elector of Saxony and the
Landgrave of Hesse urged on him the adoption
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page382" name="page382"></a>(p. 382)</span>
of a common
policy.<a id="footnotetag1062" name="footnotetag1062"></a><a href="#footnote1062">[1062]</a>
English envoys were sent to Germany with this purpose in
the spring of 1538, and German divines journeyed to England to lay the
foundation of a theological
union.<a id="footnotetag1063" name="footnotetag1063"></a><a href="#footnote1063">[1063]</a>
They remained five months,
but failed to effect an
agreement.<a id="footnotetag1064" name="footnotetag1064"></a><a href="#footnote1064">[1064]</a>
To the three points on which
they desired further reform in England, the Communion in both kinds,
the abolition of private masses and of the enforced celibacy of the
clergy, Henry himself wrote a long
reply,<a id="footnotetag1065" name="footnotetag1065"></a><a href="#footnote1065">[1065]</a>
maintaining in each
case the Catholic faith. But the conference showed that Henry was for
the time anxious to be conciliatory in religious matters, while from a
political point of view the need for an alliance grew more urgent than
ever. All Henry's efforts to break the amity between Francis and
Charles had failed; his proposals of marriage to imperial and French
princesses had come to nothing; and, in the spring of 1539, it was
rumoured that the Emperor would further demonstrate the
indissolubility of his intimacy with the French King by passing
through France from Spain to Germany, instead of going, as he had
always hitherto done, by sea, or through Italy and Austria. Cromwell
seized the opportunity and persuaded Henry to strengthen his union
with the Protestant princes by seeking a wife from a German house.</p>

<p>This policy once adopted, the task of selecting a bride was easy. As
early as
1530<a id="footnotetag1066" name="footnotetag1066"></a><a href="#footnote1066">[1066]</a>
the old Duke of Cleves had suggested
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page383" name="page383"></a>(p. 383)</span>
some marriage alliance between his own and the royal family of
England. He was closely allied to the Elector of Saxony, who had
married Sibylla, the Duke of Cleves' daughter; and the young Duke, who
was soon to succeed his father, had also claims to the Duchy of
Guelders. Guelders was a thorn in the side of the Emperor; it stood to
the Netherlands in much the same relation as Scotland stood to
England, and when there was war between Charles and Francis Guelders
had always been one of the most useful pawns in the French King's
hands. Hence an alliance between the German princes, the King of
Denmark, who had joined their political and religious union, Guelders
and England would have seriously threatened the Emperor's hold on his
Dutch
dominions.<a id="footnotetag1067" name="footnotetag1067"></a><a href="#footnote1067">[1067]</a>
This was the step which Henry was induced to
take, when he realised that Charles's friendship with France remained
unbroken, and that the Emperor had made up his mind to visit Paris.
Hints of a marriage between Henry and Anne of
Cleves<a id="footnotetag1068" name="footnotetag1068"></a><a href="#footnote1068">[1068]</a>
were thrown
out early in 1539; the only difficulty, which subsequently proved very
convenient, was that the lady had been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page384" name="page384"></a>(p. 384)</span>
promised to the son
of the Duke of Lorraine. The objection was waived on the ground that
Anne herself had not given her consent; in view of the advantages of
the match and of the Duke's financial straits, Henry agreed to forgo a
dowry; and, on the 6th of October, the treaty of marriage was
signed.<a id="footnotetag1069" name="footnotetag1069"></a><a href="#footnote1069">[1069]</a></p>

<p>Anne of Cleves had already been described to Henry by his ambassador,
Dr. Wotton, and Holbein had been sent to paint her portrait (now in
the Louvre), which Wotton pronounced "a very lively
image".<a id="footnotetag1070" name="footnotetag1070"></a><a href="#footnote1070">[1070]</a>
She
had an oval face, long nose, chestnut eyes, a light complexion, and
very pale lips. She was thirty-four years old, and in France was
reported to be ugly; but Cromwell told the King that "every one
praised her beauty, both of face and body, and one said she excelled
the Duchess of Milan as the golden sun did the silver
moon".<a id="footnotetag1071" name="footnotetag1071"></a><a href="#footnote1071">[1071]</a>
Wotton's account of her accomplishments was pitched in a minor key.
Her gentleness was universally commended, but she spent her time
chiefly in needlework. She knew no language but her own; she could
neither sing nor play upon any instrument, accomplishments which were
then considered by Germans to be unbecoming in a
lady.<a id="footnotetag1072" name="footnotetag1072"></a><a href="#footnote1072">[1072]</a>
On the
12th of December, 1539, she arrived at Calais; but boisterous weather
and bad tides delayed her there till
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page385" name="page385"></a>(p. 385)</span>
the 27th. She landed at
Deal and rode to Canterbury. On the 30th she proceeded to
Sittingbourne, and thence, on the 31st, to Rochester, where the King
met her in
disguise.<a id="footnotetag1073" name="footnotetag1073"></a><a href="#footnote1073">[1073]</a>
If he was disappointed with her appearance,
he concealed the fact from the public eye. Nothing marred her public
reception at Greenwich on the 3rd, or was suffered to hinder the
wedding, which was solemnised three days
later.<a id="footnotetag1074" name="footnotetag1074"></a><a href="#footnote1074">[1074]</a>
Henry "lovingly
embraced and kissed" his bride in public, and allowed no hint to reach
the ears of any one but his most intimate counsellors of the fact that
he had been led willingly or unwillingly into the most humiliating
situation of his reign.</p>

<p>Such was, in reality, the result of his failure to act on the
principle laid down by himself to the French ambassador two years
before. He had then declared that the choice of a wife was too
delicate a matter to be left to a deputy, and that he must see and
know a lady some time before he made up his mind to marry her. Anne of
Cleves had been selected by Cromwell, and the lady, whose beauty was,
according to Cromwell, in every one's mouth, seemed to Henry no better
than "a Flanders
mare".<a id="footnotetag1075" name="footnotetag1075"></a><a href="#footnote1075">[1075]</a>
The day after the interview at Rochester
he told Cromwell that Anne was "nothing so well as she was spoken of,"
and that, "if he had known before as much as he knew then, she should
not have come within his realm". He demanded of his Vicegerent what
remedy he had to suggest, and Cromwell had none. Next day Cranmer,
Norfolk, Suffolk, Southampton and Tunstall
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page386" name="page386"></a>(p. 386)</span>
were called in
with no better result. "Is there none other remedy," repeated Henry,
"but that I must needs, against my will, put my neck in the
yoke?"<a id="footnotetag1076" name="footnotetag1076"></a><a href="#footnote1076">[1076]</a>
Apparently there was none. The Emperor was being fêted in
Paris; to repudiate the marriage would throw the Duke of Cleves into
the arms of the allied sovereigns, alienate the German princes, and
leave Henry without a friend among the powers of Christendom. So he
made up his mind to put his neck in the yoke and to marry "the
Flanders mare".</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>Henry, however, was never patient of matrimonial or other yokes, and
it was quite certain that, as soon as he could do so without serious
risk, he would repudiate his unattractive wife, and probably other
things besides. For Anne's defects were only the last straw added to
the burden which Henry bore. He had not only been forced by
circumstances into marriage with a wife who was repugnant to him, but
into a religious and secular policy which he and the mass of his
subjects disliked. The alliance with the Protestant princes might be a
useful weapon if things came to the worst, and if there were a joint
attack on England by Francis and Charles; but, on its merits, it was
not to be compared to a good understanding with the Emperor; and Henry
would have no hesitation in throwing over the German princes when once
he saw his way to a renewal of friendship with Charles. He would
welcome, even more, a relief from the necessity of paying attention to
German divines. He had never wavered in his adhesion to the cardinal
points of the Catholic faith. He had no enmity to Catholicism,
provided it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page387" name="page387"></a>(p. 387)</span>
did not stand in his way. The spiritual
jurisdiction of Rome had been abolished in England because it imposed
limits on Henry's own authority. Some of the powers of the English
clergy had been destroyed, partly for a similar reason, and partly as
a concession to the laity. But the purely spiritual claims of the
Church remained unimpaired; the clergy were still a caste, separate
from other men, and divinely endowed with the power of performing a
daily miracle in the conversion of the bread and wine into the Body
and Blood of Jesus Christ. Even when the Protestant alliance seemed
most indispensable, Henry endeavoured to convince Lutherans of the
truth of the Catholic doctrine of the mass, and could not refrain from
persecuting heretics with a zeal that shook the confidence of his
reforming allies. His honour, he thought, was involved in his success
in proving that he, with his royal supremacy, could defend the faith
more effectively than the Pope, with all his pretended powers; and he
took a personal interest in the conversion and burning of heretics.
Several instances are recorded of his arguing a whole day with
Sacramentaries,<a id="footnotetag1077" name="footnotetag1077"></a><a href="#footnote1077">[1077]</a>
exercises which exhibited to advantage at once
the royal authority and the royal learning in spiritual matters. His
beliefs were not due to caprice or to ignorance; probably no bishop in
his realm was more deeply read in heterodox
theology.<a id="footnotetag1078" name="footnotetag1078"></a><a href="#footnote1078">[1078]</a>
He was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page388" name="page388"></a>(p. 388)</span>
constantly on the look-out for books by Luther and other
heresiarchs, and he kept quite a respectable theological library at
hand for private use. The tenacity with which he clung to orthodox
creeds and Catholic forms was not only strengthened by study but
rooted in the depths of his character. To devout but fundamentally
irreligious men, like Henry VIII. and Louis XIV., rites and ceremonies
are a great consolation; and Henry seldom neglected to creep to the
Cross on Good Friday, to serve the priest at mass, to receive holy
bread and holy water every Sunday, and daily to use "all other
laudable
ceremonies".<a id="footnotetag1079" name="footnotetag1079"></a><a href="#footnote1079">[1079]</a></p>

<p>With such feelings at heart, a union with Protestants could never for
Henry be more than a <i>mariage de convenance</i>; and in this, as in other
things, he carried with him the bulk of popular sympathy. In 1539 it
was said that no man in London durst speak against Catholic usages,
and, in Lent of that year, a man was hanged, apparently at the
instance of the Recorder of London, for eating flesh on a
Friday.<a id="footnotetag1080" name="footnotetag1080"></a><a href="#footnote1080">[1080]</a>
The attack on the Church had been limited to its
privileges and to its property; its doctrine had scarcely been
touched. The upper classes among the laity had been gorged with
monastic spoils; they were disposed to rest and be thankful. The
middle classes had been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page389" name="page389"></a>(p. 389)</span>
satisfied to some extent by the
restriction of clerical fees, and by the prohibition of the clergy
from competing with laymen in profitable trades, such as brewing,
tanning, and speculating in land and houses. There was also the
general reaction which always follows a period of change. How far that
reaction had gone, Henry first learnt from the Parliament which met on
the 28th of April, 1539.</p>

<p>The elections were characterised by more court interference than is
traceable at any other period during the reign, though even on this
occasion the evidence is fragmentary and affects comparatively few
constituencies.<a id="footnotetag1081" name="footnotetag1081"></a><a href="#footnote1081">[1081]</a>
It was, moreover, Cromwell and not the King who
sought to pack the House of Commons in favour of his own particular
policy; and the attempt produced discontent in various constituencies
and a riot in one at
least.<a id="footnotetag1082" name="footnotetag1082"></a><a href="#footnote1082">[1082]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page390" name="page390"></a>(p. 390)</span>
The Earl of Southampton
was required to use his influence on behalf of Cromwell's nominees at
Farnham, although that borough was within the Bishop of Winchester's
preserves.<a id="footnotetag1083" name="footnotetag1083"></a><a href="#footnote1083">[1083]</a>
So, too, Cromwell's henchman, Wriothesley, was
returned for the county of Southampton in spite of Gardiner's
opposition. Never, till the days of the Stuarts, was there a more
striking instance of the futility of these tactics; for the House of
Commons, which Cromwell took so much pains to secure, passed, without
a dissentient, the Bill of Attainder against him; and before it was
dissolved, the bishop, against whose influence Cromwell had especially
exerted himself, had taken Cromwell's place in the royal favour. There
was, indeed, no possibility of stemming the tide which was flowing
against the Vicegerent and in favour of the King; and Cromwell was
forced to swim with the stream in the vain hope of saving himself from
disaster.</p>

<p>The principal measure passed in this Parliament was the Act of Six
Articles, and it was designed to secure that unity and concord in
opinions which had not been effected by the King's injunctions. The
Act affirmed the doctrine of Transubstantiation, declared that the
administration of the Sacrament in both kinds was not necessary, that
priests might not marry, that vows of chastity were perpetual, that
private masses were meet and necessary, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page391" name="page391"></a>(p. 391)</span>
auricular
confession was expedient and necessary. Burning was the penalty for
once denying the first article, and a felon's death for twice denying
any of the others. This was practically the first Act of Uniformity,
the earliest definition by Parliament of the faith of the Church. It
showed that the mass of the laity were still orthodox to the core,
that they could persecute as ruthlessly as the Church itself, and that
their only desire was to do the persecution themselves. The bill was
carried through Parliament by means of a coalition of King and
laity<a id="footnotetag1084" name="footnotetag1084"></a><a href="#footnote1084">[1084]</a>
against Cromwell and a minority of reforming bishops, who
are said only to have relinquished their opposition at Henry's
personal
intervention;<a id="footnotetag1085" name="footnotetag1085"></a><a href="#footnote1085">[1085]</a>
and the royal wishes were communicated,
when the King was not present in person, through Norfolk and not
through the royal Vicegerent.</p>

<p>It was clear that Cromwell was trembling to his fall. The enmity shown
in Parliament to his doctrinal tendencies was not the result of royal
dictation; for even this Parliament, which gave royal proclamations
the force of law, could be independent when it chose. The draft of the
Act of Proclamations, as originally submitted to the House of Commons,
provoked a hot debate, was thrown out, and another was substituted
more in accord with the sense of the
House.<a id="footnotetag1086" name="footnotetag1086"></a><a href="#footnote1086">[1086]</a>
Parliament could
have rejected the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page392" name="page392"></a>(p. 392)</span>
second as easily as it did the first, had
it wished. Willingly and wittingly it placed this weapon in the royal
hands,<a id="footnotetag1087" name="footnotetag1087"></a><a href="#footnote1087">[1087]</a>
and the chief motive for its action was that overwhelming
desire for "union and concord in opinion" which lay at the root of the
Six Articles. Only one class of offences against royal proclamations
could be punished with death, and those were offences "against any
proclamation to be made by the King's Highness, his heirs or
successors, for or concerning any kind of heresies against Christian
doctrine". The King might define the faith by proclamations, and the
standard of orthodoxy thus set up was to be enforced by the heaviest
legal penalties. England, thought Parliament, could only be kept
united against her foreign foes by a rigid uniformity of opinion; and
that uniformity could only be enforced by the royal authority based on
lay support, for the Church was now deeply divided in doctrine against
itself.</p>

<p>Such was the temper of England at the end of 1539. Cromwell and his
policy, the union with the German princes and the marriage with Anne
of Cleves were merely makeshifts. They stood on no surer foundation
than the passing political need of some counterpoise to the alliance
of Francis and Charles. So long as that need remained, the marriage
would hold good, and Henry would strive to dissemble; but not a moment
longer. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page393" name="page393"></a>(p. 393)</span>
revolution came with startling rapidity; in
April, 1540, Marillac, the French ambassador, reported that Cromwell
was tottering.<a id="footnotetag1088" name="footnotetag1088"></a><a href="#footnote1088">[1088]</a>
The reason was not far to seek. No sooner had the
Emperor passed out of France, than he began to excuse himself from
fulfilling his engagements to Francis. He was resolute never to yield
Milan, for which Francis never ceased to yearn. Charles would have
found Francis a useful ally for the conquest of England, but his own
possessions were now threatened in more than one quarter, and
especially by the English and German alliance. Henry skilfully widened
the breach between the two friends, and, while professing the utmost
regard for Francis, gave Charles to understand that he vastly
preferred the Emperor's alliance to that of the Protestant princes.
Before April he had convinced himself that Charles was more bent on
reducing Germany and the Netherlands to order than on any attempt
against England, and that the abandonment of the Lutheran princes
would not lead to their combination with the Emperor and Francis.
Accordingly he returned a very cold answer when the Duke of Cleves's
ambassadors came, in May, to demand his assistance in securing for the
Duke the Duchy of
Guelders.<a id="footnotetag1089" name="footnotetag1089"></a><a href="#footnote1089">[1089]</a></p>

<p>Cromwell's fall was not, however, effected without some violent
oscillations, strikingly like the quick changes which preceded the
ruin of Robespierre during the Reign of Terror in France. The
Vicegerent had filled the Court and the Government with his own
nominees; at least half a dozen bishops, with Cranmer at their head,
inclined to his theological and political views; Lord Chancellor
Audley and the Earl of Southamton were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page394" name="page394"></a>(p. 394)</span>
of the same
persuasion; and a small but zealous band of reformers did their best,
by ballads and sermons, to prove that the people were thirsting for
further religious change. The Council, said Marillac, was divided,
each party seeking to destroy the other. Henry let the factions fight
till he thought the time was come for him to intervene. In February,
1540, there was a theological encounter between Gardiner and Barnes,
the principal agent in Henry's dealings with the Lutherans, and Barnes
was forced to
recant;<a id="footnotetag1090" name="footnotetag1090"></a><a href="#footnote1090">[1090]</a>
in April Gardiner and one or two
conservatives, who had long been excluded from the Council, were
believed to have been
readmitted;<a id="footnotetag1091" name="footnotetag1091"></a><a href="#footnote1091">[1091]</a>
and it was reported that
Tunstall would succeed Cromwell as the King's
Vicegerent.<a id="footnotetag1092" name="footnotetag1092"></a><a href="#footnote1092">[1092]</a>
But a
few days later two of Cromwell's satellites, Wriothesley and Sadleir,
were made Secretaries of State; Cromwell himself was created Earl of
Essex; and, in May, the Bishop of Chichester and two other opponents
of reform were sent to the
Tower.<a id="footnotetag1093" name="footnotetag1093"></a><a href="#footnote1093">[1093]</a>
At last Henry struck. On the
10th of June Cromwell was arrested; he had, wrote the Council, "not
only been counterworking the King's aims for the settlement of
religion, but had said that, if the King and the realm varied from his
opinions, he would withstand them, and that he hoped in another year
or two to bring things to that frame that the King could not resist
it".<a id="footnotetag1094" name="footnotetag1094"></a><a href="#footnote1094">[1094]</a>
His cries for mercy evoked no response in that hardened
age.<a id="footnotetag1095" name="footnotetag1095"></a><a href="#footnote1095">[1095]</a>
Parliament condemned him unheard, and, on the 28th of July,
he was beheaded.</p>

<p>Henry had in reality come to the conclusion that it was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page395" name="page395"></a>(p. 395)</span>
safe
to dispense with Anne of Cleves and her relatives; and with his will
there was easily found a way. His case, as stated by himself, was, as
usual, a most ingenious mixture of fact and fiction, reason and
sophistry. His "intention" had been defective, and therefore his
administration of the sacrament of marriage had been invalid. He was
not a free agent because fear of being left defenceless against
Francis and Charles had driven him under the yoke. His marriage had
only been a conditional form. Anne had never received a release from
her contract with the son of the Duke of Lorraine; Henry had only gone
through the ceremony on the assumption that that release would be
forthcoming; and actuated by this conscientious scruple, he had
refrained from consummating the match. To give verisimilitude to this
last statement, he added the further detail that he found his bride
personally repugnant. He therefore sought from "our" Church a
declaration of nullity. Anne was prudently ready to submit to its
decision; and, through Convocation, Henry's Church, which in his view
existed mainly to transact his ecclesiastical business, declared, on
the 7th of July, that the marriage was null and
void.<a id="footnotetag1096" name="footnotetag1096"></a><a href="#footnote1096">[1096]</a>
Anne
received a handsome endowment of four thousand pounds a year in lands,
was given two country residences, and lived on amicable terms with
Henry<a id="footnotetag1097" name="footnotetag1097"></a><a href="#footnote1097">[1097]</a>
and his successors till 1558, when she died and was buried
in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Henry's neck was freed from the matrimonial yoke and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page396" name="page396"></a>(p. 396)</span>
the
German entanglement. The news was promptly sent to Charles, who
remarked that Henry would always find him his loving brother and most
cordial
friend.<a id="footnotetag1098" name="footnotetag1098"></a><a href="#footnote1098">[1098]</a>
At Antwerp it was said that the King had
alienated the Germans, but gained the Emperor and France in their
stead.<a id="footnotetag1099" name="footnotetag1099"></a><a href="#footnote1099">[1099]</a>
Luther declared that "Junker Harry meant to be God and to
do as pleased
himself";<a id="footnotetag1100" name="footnotetag1100"></a><a href="#footnote1100">[1100]</a>
and Melancthon, previously so ready to
find excuses, now denounced the English King as a Nero, and expressed
a wish that God would put it into the mind of some bold man to
assassinate
him.<a id="footnotetag1101" name="footnotetag1101"></a><a href="#footnote1101">[1101]</a>
Francis sighed when he heard the news,
foreseeing a future alliance against
him,<a id="footnotetag1102" name="footnotetag1102"></a><a href="#footnote1102">[1102]</a>
but the Emperor's
secretary believed that God was bringing good out of all these
things.<a id="footnotetag1103" name="footnotetag1103"></a><a href="#footnote1103">[1103]</a></p>




<h3>CHAPTER XV.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page397" name="page397"></a>(p. 397)</span>
</h3>

<h4>THE FINAL STRUGGLE.</h4>


<p>The first of the "good things" brought out of the divorce of Anne of
Cleves was a fifth wife for the much-married monarch. Parliament,
which had petitioned Henry to solve the doubts troubling his subjects
as to the validity (that is to say, political advantages) of his union
with Anne, now besought him, "for the good of his people," to enter
once more the holy state of matrimony, in the hope of more numerous
issue. The lady had been already selected by the predominant party,
and used as an instrument in procuring the divorce of her predecessor
and the fall of Cromwell; for, if her morals were something lax,
Catherine Howard's orthodoxy was beyond dispute. She was niece of
Cromwell's great enemy, the Duke of Norfolk; and it was at the house
of Bishop Gardiner that she was first given the opportunity of
subduing the King to her
charms.<a id="footnotetag1104" name="footnotetag1104"></a><a href="#footnote1104">[1104]</a>
She was to play the part in the
Catholic reaction that Anne Boleyn had done in the Protestant
revolution. Both religious parties were unfortunate in the choice of
their lady protagonists. Catherine Howard's father, in spite of his
rank, was very penurious, and his daughter's education had been
neglected, while her character had been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page398" name="page398"></a>(p. 398)</span>
left at the mercy of
any chance tempter. She had already formed compromising relations with
three successive suitors. Her music master, Mannock, boasted that she
had promised to be his mistress; a kinsman, named Dereham, called her
his wife; and she was reported to be engaged to her cousin,
Culpepper.<a id="footnotetag1105" name="footnotetag1105"></a><a href="#footnote1105">[1105]</a>
Marillac thought her beauty was
commonplace;<a id="footnotetag1106" name="footnotetag1106"></a><a href="#footnote1106">[1106]</a>
but that, to judge by her portraits, seems a disparaging verdict. Her
eyes were hazel, her hair was auburn, and Nature had been at least as
kind to her as to any of Henry's wives. Even Marillac admitted that
she had a very winning countenance. Her age is uncertain, but she had
almost certainly seen more than the twenty-one years politely put down
to her account. Her marriage, like that of Anne Boleyn, was private.
Marillac thought she was already wedded to Henry by the 21st of July,
and the Venetian ambassador at the Court of Charles V. said that the
ceremony took place two days after the sentence of Convocation (7th
July).<a id="footnotetag1107" name="footnotetag1107"></a><a href="#footnote1107">[1107]</a>
That may be the date of the betrothal, but the marriage
itself was privately celebrated at Oatlands on the 28th of
July,<a id="footnotetag1108" name="footnotetag1108"></a><a href="#footnote1108">[1108]</a>
and Catherine was publicly recognised as Queen at Hampton Court
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page399" name="page399"></a>(p. 399)</span>
 on the 8th of August, and prayed for as such in the churches on
the following Sunday.</p>

<p>The King was thoroughly satisfied with his new marriage from every
point of view. The reversal of the policy of the last few years, which
he had always disliked and for which he avoided responsibility as well
as he could, relieved him at once from the necessity of playing a part
and from the pressing anxiety of foreign dangers. These troubles had
preyed upon his mind and impaired his health; but now, for a time, his
spirits revived and his health returned. He began to rise every
morning, even in the winter, between five and six, and rode for four
or five hours. He was enamoured of his bride; her views and those of
her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, and of her patron, Bishop Gardiner,
were in much closer accord with his own than Anne Boleyn's or
Cromwell's had been. Until almost the close of his reign Norfolk was
the chief instrument of his secular policy, while Gardiner represented
his ecclesiastical
views;<a id="footnotetag1109" name="footnotetag1109"></a><a href="#footnote1109">[1109]</a>
but neither succeeded to the place
which Wolsey had held and Cromwell had tried to secure. Henceforth the
King had no Prime Minister; there was no second Vicegerent, and the
praise or the blame for his policy can be given to no one but Henry.</p>

<p>That policy was, in foreign affairs, a close adherence to the Emperor,
partly because it was almost universally held to be the safest course
for England to pursue, and partly because it gave Henry a free hand
for the development of his imperialist designs on Scotland. In
domestic affairs the predominant note was the extreme rigour with
which the King's secular autocracy, his supremacy over the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page400" name="page400"></a>(p. 400)</span>
Church, and the Church's orthodox doctrine were imposed on his
subjects. Although the Act of Six Articles had been passed in 1539,
Cromwell appears to have prevented the issue of commissions for its
execution. This culpable negligence did not please Parliament, and,
just before his fall, another Act was passed for the more effective
enforcement of the Six Articles. One relaxation was found necessary;
it was impossible to inflict the death penalty on
"incontinent"<a id="footnotetag1110" name="footnotetag1110"></a><a href="#footnote1110">[1110]</a>
priests, because there were so many. But that was the only indulgence
granted. Two days after Cromwell's death, a vivid illustration was
given of the spirit which was henceforth to dominate the Government.
Six men were executed at the same time; three were priests, condemned
to be hanged as traitors for denying the royal supremacy; three were
heretics, condemned to be burnt for impugning the Catholic
faith.<a id="footnotetag1111" name="footnotetag1111"></a><a href="#footnote1111">[1111]</a></p>

<p>And yet there was no peace. Henry, who had succeeded in so much, had,
with the full concurrence of the majority of his people, entered upon
a task in which he was foredoomed to failure. Not all the whips with
six strings, not all the fires at Smithfield, could compel that unity
and concord in opinion which Henry so much desired, but which he had
unwittingly done so much to destroy. He might denounce the diversities
of belief to which his opening of the Bible in English churches had
given rise; but men, who had caught a glimpse of hidden verities,
could not all be forced to deny the things which they had seen. The
most lasting result of Henry's repressive tyranny was the stimulus it
gave to reform in the reign of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page401" name="page401"></a>(p. 401)</span>
son, even as the
persecutions of Mary finally ruined in England the cause of the Roman
Church. Henry's bishops themselves could scarcely be brought to
agreement. Latimer and Shaxton lost their sees; but the submission of
the rest did not extend to complete recantation, and the endeavour to
stretch all his subjects on the Procrustean bed of Six Articles was
one of Henry's least successful
enterprises.<a id="footnotetag1112" name="footnotetag1112"></a><a href="#footnote1112">[1112]</a>
It was easier to
sacrifice a portion of his monastic spoils to found new bishoprics.
This had been a project of Wolsey's, interrupted by the Cardinal's
fall. Parliament subsequently authorised Henry to erect twenty-six
sees; he actually established six, the Bishoprics of Peterborough,
Oxford, Chester, Gloucester, Bristol and Westminster. Funds were also
provided for the endowment, in both universities, of Regius
professorships of Divinity, Hebrew, Greek, Civil Law and Medicine; and
the royal interest in the advancement of science was further evinced
by the grant of a charter to the College of Surgeons, similar to that
accorded early in the reign to the
Physicians.<a id="footnotetag1113" name="footnotetag1113"></a><a href="#footnote1113">[1113]</a></p>

<p>Disloyalty,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page402" name="page402"></a>(p. 402)</span>
meanwhile, was no more extinct than diversity in
religious opinion. Early in 1541 there was a conspiracy under Sir John
Neville, in Lincolnshire, and about the same time there were signs
that the Council itself could not be immediately steadied after the
violent disturbances of the previous year. Pate, the ambassador at the
Emperor's Court, absconded to Rome in fear of arrest, and his uncle,
Longland, Bishop of Lincoln, was for a time in confinement; Sir John
Wallop, Sir Thomas Wyatt, diplomatist and poet, and his secretary, the
witty and cautious Sir John Mason, were sent to the Tower; both
Cromwell's henchmen, Wriothesley and Sadleir, seem to have incurred
suspicion.<a id="footnotetag1114" name="footnotetag1114"></a><a href="#footnote1114">[1114]</a>
Wyatt, Wallop and Mason were soon released, while
Wriothesley and Sadleir regained favour by abjuring their former
opinions; but it was evident that the realisation of arbitrary power
was gradually destroying Henry's better nature. His suspicion was
aroused on the slightest pretext, and his temper was getting worse.
Ill-health contributed not a little to this frame of mind. The ulcer
on his leg caused him such agony that he sometimes went almost black
in the face and speechless from
pain.<a id="footnotetag1115" name="footnotetag1115"></a><a href="#footnote1115">[1115]</a>
He was beginning to look
grey and old, and was growing daily more corpulent and unwieldy. He
had, he said, on hearing of Neville's rebellion, an evil people to
rule; he would, he vowed, make them so poor that it would be out of
their power to rebel; and, before he set out for the North to
extinguish the discontent and to arrange a meeting with James V., he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page403" name="page403"></a>(p. 403)</span>
cleared the Tower by sending all its prisoners, including the
aged Countess of Salisbury, to the block.</p>

<p>A greater trial than the failure of James to accept his invitation to
York awaited Henry on his return from the North. Rumours of Catherine
Howard's past indiscretions had at length reached the ears of the
Privy Council. On All Saints' Day, 1541, Henry directed his confessor,
the Bishop of Lincoln, to give thanks to God with him for the good
life he was leading and hoped to lead with his present
Queen,<a id="footnotetag1116" name="footnotetag1116"></a><a href="#footnote1116">[1116]</a>
"after sundry troubles of mind which had happened to him by
marriages".<a id="footnotetag1117" name="footnotetag1117"></a><a href="#footnote1117">[1117]</a>
At last he thought he had reached the haven of
domestic peace, whence no roving fancy should tempt him to stray.
Twenty-four hours later Cranmer put in his hand proofs of the Queen's
misconduct. Henry refused to believe in this rude awakening from his
dreams; he ordered a strict investigation into the charges. Its
results left no room for doubt. Dereham confessed his intercourse;
Mannock admitted that he had taken liberties; and, presently, the
Queen herself acknowledged her guilt. The King was overwhelmed with
shame and vexation; he shed bitter tears, a thing, said the Council,
"strange in his courage". He "has wonderfully felt the case of the
Queen," wrote
Chapuys;<a id="footnotetag1118" name="footnotetag1118"></a><a href="#footnote1118">[1118]</a>
"he took such grief," added Marillac,
"that of late it was thought he had gone
mad".<a id="footnotetag1119" name="footnotetag1119"></a><a href="#footnote1119">[1119]</a>
He seems to have
promised his wife a pardon, and she might have escaped with nothing
worse than a divorce, had not proofs come to light of her misconduct
with Culpepper after her marriage with Henry, and even during their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page404" name="page404"></a>(p. 404)</span>
recent progress in the North. This offence was high treason,
and could not be covered by the King's pardon for Catherine's
pre-nuptial immorality. Henry, however, was not at ease until
Parliament, in January, 1542, considerately relieved him of all
responsibility. The faithful Lords and Commons begged him not to take
the matter too heavily, but to permit them freely to proceed with an
Act of Attainder, and to give his assent thereto by commission under
the great seal without any words or ceremony, which might cause him
pain. Thus originated the practice of giving the royal assent to Acts
of Parliament by
commission.<a id="footnotetag1120" name="footnotetag1120"></a><a href="#footnote1120">[1120]</a>
Another innovation was introduced
into the Act of Attainder, whereby it was declared treason for any
woman to marry the King if her previous life had been unchaste; "few,
if any, ladies now at Court," commented the cynical Chapuys, "would
henceforth aspire to such an
honour".<a id="footnotetag1121" name="footnotetag1121"></a><a href="#footnote1121">[1121]</a>
The bill received the
royal assent on the 11th of February, Catherine having declined
Henry's permission to go down to Parliament and defend herself in
person. On the 10th she was removed to the Tower, being dressed in
black velvet and treated with "as much honour as when she was
reigning".<a id="footnotetag1122" name="footnotetag1122"></a><a href="#footnote1122">[1122]</a>
Three days later she was beheaded on the same spot
where the sword had severed the fair neck of Anne Boleyn.</p>

<p>Thus ended one of the "good things" which had come out of the
repudiation of Anne of Cleves. Other advantages were more permanent.
The breach between Francis and Charles grew ever wider. In 1541 the
French King's ambassadors to the Turk were seized and executed by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page405" name="page405"></a>(p. 405)</span>
the order of the imperial governor of
Milan.<a id="footnotetag1123" name="footnotetag1123"></a><a href="#footnote1123">[1123]</a>
The outrage
brought Francis's irritation to a head. He was still pursuing the
shadow of a departed glory and the vain hope of dominion beyond the
Alps. He had secured none of the benefits he anticipated from the
imperial alliance; his interviews with Charles and professions of
friendship were lost on that heartless schemer, and he realised the
force of Henry's gibe at his expectations from Charles. "I have
myself," said Henry, "held interviews for three weeks together with
the Emperor." Both sovereigns began to compete for England's favour.
The French, said Chapuys, "now almost offer the English <i>carte
blanche</i> for an
alliance";<a id="footnotetag1124" name="footnotetag1124"></a><a href="#footnote1124">[1124]</a>
and he told Charles that England
must, at any price, be secured in the imperial interest. In June,
1542, Francis declared war on the Emperor, and, by the end of July,
four French armies were invading or threatening Charles's dominions.
Henry, in spite of all temptations, was not to be the tool of either;
he had designs of his own; and the breach between Francis and Charles
gave him a unique opportunity for completing his imperialist projects,
by extending his sway over the one portion of the British Isles which
yet remained independent.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>As in the case of similar enterprises, Henry could easily find
colourable pretexts for his attack on Scots
independence.<a id="footnotetag1125" name="footnotetag1125"></a><a href="#footnote1125">[1125]</a> Beton
had been made cardinal with the express objects of publishing in
Scotland the Pope's Bull against Henry,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page406" name="page406"></a>(p. 406)</span>
and of instigating
James V. to undertake its execution; and the Cardinal held a high
place in the Scots King's confidence. James had intrigued against
England with both Charles V. and Francis I., and hopes had been
instilled into his mind that he had only to cross the Border to be
welcomed, at least in the North, as a deliverer from Henry's
oppression. Refugees from the Pilgrimage of Grace found shelter in
Scotland, and the ceaseless Border warfare might, at any time, have
provided either King with a case for war, if war he desired. The
desire varied, of course, with the prospects of success. James V.
would, without doubt, have invaded England if Francis and Charles had
begun an attack, and if a general crusade had been proclaimed against
Henry. So, too, war between the two European rivals afforded Henry
some chance of success, and placed in his way an irresistible
temptation to settle his account with Scotland. He revived the
obsolete claim to suzerainty, and pretended that the Scots were
rebels.<a id="footnotetag1126" name="footnotetag1126"></a><a href="#footnote1126">[1126]</a>
Had not James V., moreover, refused to meet him at York
to discuss the questions at issue between them? Henry might well have
maintained that he sought no extension of territory, but was actuated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page407" name="page407"></a>(p. 407)</span>
solely by the desire to remove the perpetual menace to
England involved in the presence of a foe on his northern Borders, in
close alliance with his inveterate enemy across the Channel. He seems,
indeed, to have been willing to conclude peace, if the Scots would
repudiate their ancient connection with France; but this they
considered the sheet-anchor of their safety, and they declined to
destroy it. They gave Henry greater offence by defeating an English
raid at Halidon Rig, and the desire to avenge a trifling reverse
became a point of honour in the English mind and a powerful factor in
English policy.</p>

<p>The negotiations lasted throughout the summer of 1542. In October
Norfolk crossed the Borders. The transport broke down; the
commissariat was most imperfect; and Sir George Lawson of Cumberland
was unable to supply the army with sufficient
beer.<a id="footnotetag1127" name="footnotetag1127"></a><a href="#footnote1127">[1127]</a>
Norfolk had
to turn back at Kelso, having accomplished nothing beyond
devastation.<a id="footnotetag1128" name="footnotetag1128"></a><a href="#footnote1128">[1128]</a>
James now sought his revenge. He replied to
Norfolk's invasion on the East by throwing the Scots across the
Borders on the West. The Warden was warned by his spies, but he had
only a few hundreds to meet the thousands of Scots. But, if Norfolk's
invasion was an empty parade, the Scots attempt was a fearful rout.
Under their incompetent leader, Oliver Sinclair, they got entangled in
Solway Moss; enormous numbers were slain or taken prisoners, and among
them were some of the greatest men in Scotland. James died
broken-hearted at the news, leaving his kingdom to the week-old
infant, Mary, Queen of
Scots.<a id="footnotetag1129" name="footnotetag1129"></a><a href="#footnote1129">[1129]</a>
The triumph of Flodden
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page408" name="page408"></a>(p. 408)</span>
Field was repeated; a second Scots King had fallen; and, for a second
time in Henry's reign, Scotland was a prey to the woes of a royal
minority.</p>

<p>Within a few days of the Scots disaster, Lord Lisle (afterwards Duke
of Northumberland) expressed a wish that the infant Queen were in
Henry's hands and betrothed to Prince Edward, and a fear that the
French would seek to remove her beyond the
seas.<a id="footnotetag1130" name="footnotetag1130"></a><a href="#footnote1130">[1130]</a>
To realise the
hope and to prevent the fear were the main objects of Henry's foreign
policy for the rest of his reign. Could he but have secured the
marriage of Mary to Edward, he would have carried both England and
Scotland many a weary stage along the path to Union and to Empire.
But, unfortunately, he was not content with this brilliant prospect
for his son. He grasped himself at the Scottish crown; he must be not
merely a suzerain shadow, but a real sovereign. The Scottish peers,
who had been taken at Solway Moss, were sworn to Henry VIII., "to set
forth his Majesty's title that he had to the realm of
Scotland".<a id="footnotetag1131" name="footnotetag1131"></a><a href="#footnote1131">[1131]</a>
Early in 1543 an official declaration was issued, "containing the just
causes and considerations of this present war with the Scots, wherein
also appeareth the true and right title that the King's most royal
Majesty hath to the sovereignty of Scotland"; while Parliament
affirmed that "the late pretensed King of Scots was but an usurper of
the crown and realm of Scotland," and that Henry had "now at this
present (by the infinite goodness of God), a time apt and propice for
the recovery of his said right and title to the said crown and realm
of Scotland".<a id="footnotetag1132" name="footnotetag1132"></a><a href="#footnote1132">[1132]</a>
The promulgation of these high-sounding
pretensions was fatal to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page409" name="page409"></a>(p. 409)</span>
the cause which Henry had at heart.
Henry VII. had pursued the earlier and wiser part of the Scottish
policy of Edward I., namely, union by marriage; Henry VIII. resorted
to his later policy and strove to change a vague suzerainty into a
defined and galling sovereignty. Seeing no means of resisting the
victorious English arms, the Scots in March, 1543, agreed to the
marriage between Henry's son and their infant Queen. But to admit
Henry's extravagant claims to Scottish sovereignty was quite a
different matter. The mere mention of them was sufficient to excite
distrust and patriotic resentment. The French Catholic party led by
Cardinal Beton was strengthened, and, when Francis declared that he
would never desert his ancient ally, and gave an earnest of his
intentions by sending ships and money and men to their aid, the Scots
repudiated their compact with England, and entered into negotiations
for marrying their Queen to a prince in
France.<a id="footnotetag1133" name="footnotetag1133"></a><a href="#footnote1133">[1133]</a></p>

<p>Such a danger to England must at all costs be averted. Marriages
between Scots kings and French princesses had never boded good to
England; but the marriage of the Queen of Scotland to a French prince,
and possibly to one who might succeed to the French throne,
transcended all the other perils with which England could be
threatened. The union of the Scots and French crowns would have
destroyed the possibility of a British Empire. Henry had sadly
mismanaged the business through vaulting ambition, but there was
little fault to be found with his efforts to prevent the union of
France and Scotland; and that was the real objective of his last war
with France. His aim was not mere military glory or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page410" name="page410"></a>(p. 410)</span>
the
conquest of France, as it had been in his earlier years under the
guidance of Wolsey; it was to weaken or destroy a support which
enabled Scotland to resist the union with England, and portended a
union between Scotland and France. The Emperor's efforts to draw
England into his war with France thus met with a comparatively ready
response. In May, 1543, a secret treaty between Henry and Charles was
ratified; on the 22nd of June a joint intimation of war was notified
to the French ambassador; and a detachment of English troops, under
Sir John Wallop and Sir Thomas Seymour, was sent to aid the
imperialists in their campaign in the north of France.</p>

<p>Before hostilities actually broke out, Henry wedded his sixth and last
wife. Catherine Parr was almost as much married as Henry himself.
Thirty-one years of age in 1543, she had already been twice made a
widow; her first husband was one Edward Borough, her second, Lord
Latimer. Latimer had died at the end of 1542, and Catherine's hand was
immediately sought by Sir Thomas Seymour, Henry's younger
brother-in-law. Seymour was handsome and won her heart, but he was to
be her fourth, and not her third, husband; her will "was overruled by
a higher power," and, on the 12th of July, she was married to Henry at
Hampton
Court.<a id="footnotetag1134" name="footnotetag1134"></a><a href="#footnote1134">[1134]</a>
Catherine was small in stature, and appears to
have made little impression by her beauty; but her character was
beyond reproach, and she exercised a wholesome influence on Henry
during his closing years. Her task can have been no light one, but her
tact overcame all difficulties. She nursed the King with great
devotion, and succeeded to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page411" name="page411"></a>(p. 411)</span>
some extent in mitigating the
violence of his temper. She intervened to save victims from the
penalties of the Act of Six Articles; reconciled Elizabeth with her
father; and was regarded with affection by both Henry's daughters.
Suspicions of her orthodoxy and a theological dispute she once had
with the King are said to have given rise to a reactionary plot
against
her.<a id="footnotetag1135" name="footnotetag1135"></a><a href="#footnote1135">[1135]</a>
"A good hearing it is," Henry is reported as
saying, "when women become such clerks; and a thing much to my comfort
to come in mine old days to be taught by my wife!" Catherine explained
that her remarks were only intended to "minister talk," and that it
would be unbecoming in her to assert opinions contrary to those of her
lord. "Is it so, sweetheart?" said Henry; "then are we perfect
friends;" and when Lord Chancellor Wriothesley came to arrest her, he
was, we are told, abused by the King as a knave, a beast and a fool.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>The winter of 1543-44 and the following spring were spent in
preparations for war on two
fronts.<a id="footnotetag1136" name="footnotetag1136"></a><a href="#footnote1136">[1136]</a>
The punishment of the Scots
for repudiating their engagements to England was entrusted to the
skilful hands of Henry's brother-in-law, the Earl of Hertford; while
the King himself was to renew the martial exploits of his youth by
crossing the Channel and leading an army in person against the French
King. The Emperor was to invade France from the north-east; the two
monarchs were then to effect a junction and march on Paris. There is,
however, no instance in the first half of the sixteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page412" name="page412"></a>(p. 412)</span>
century of two sovereigns heartily combining to secure any one object
whatever. Charles and Henry both wanted to extract concessions from
Francis, but the concessions were very different, and neither monarch
cared much for those which the other demanded. Henry's ultimate end
related to Scotland, Charles's to Milan and the Lutherans. The Emperor
sought to make Francis relinquish his claim to Milan and his support
of the German princes; Henry was bent on compelling him to abandon the
cause of Scottish independence. If Charles could secure his own terms,
he would, without the least hesitation, leave Henry to get what he
could by himself; and Henry was equally ready to do Charles a similar
turn. His suspicions of the Emperor determined his course; he was
resolved to obtain some tangible result; and, before he would advance
any farther, he sat down to besiege Boulogne. Its capture had been one
of the objects of Suffolk's invasion of 1523, when Wolsey and his
imperialist allies had induced Henry to forgo the design. The result
of that folly was not forgotten. Suffolk, his ablest general, now well
stricken in years, was there to recall it; and, under Suffolk's
directions, the siege of Boulogne was vigorously pressed. It fell on
the 14th of September. Charles, meanwhile, was convinced that Boulogne
was all Henry wanted, and that the English would never advance to
support him. So, five days after the fall of Boulogne, he made his
peace with
Francis.<a id="footnotetag1137" name="footnotetag1137"></a><a href="#footnote1137">[1137]</a>
Henry, of course, was loud in his
indignation; the Emperor had made no effort to include him in the
settlement, and repeated embassies were sent in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page413" name="page413"></a>(p. 413)</span>
autumn
to keep Charles to the terms of his treaty with England, and to
persuade him to renew the war in the following spring.</p>

<p>His labours were all in vain, and Henry, for the first time in his
life was left to face an actual French invasion of England. The
horizon seemed clouded at every point. Hertford, indeed, had carried
out his instructions in Scotland with signal success. Leith had been
burnt and Edinburgh sacked. But, as soon as he left for Boulogne,
things went wrong in the North, and, in February, 1545, Evers suffered
defeat from the Scots at Ancrum Moor. Now, when Henry was left without
an ally, when the Scots were victorious in the North, when France was
ready to launch an Armada against the southern coasts of England, now,
surely, was the time for a national uprising to depose the
bloodthirsty tyrant, the enemy of the Church, the persecutor of his
people. Strangely enough his people did, and even desired, nothing of
the sort. Popular discontent existed only in the imagination of his
enemies; Henry retained to the last his hold over the mind of his
people. Never had they been called to pay such a series of loans,
subsidies and benevolences; never did they pay them so cheerfully. The
King set a royal example by coining his plate and mortgaging his
estates at the call of national defence; and, in the summer, he went
down in person to Portsmouth to meet the threatened invasion. The
French attack had begun on Boulogne, where Norfolk's carelessness had
put into their hands some initial advantages. But, before dawn, on the
6th of February, Hertford sallied out of Boulogne with four thousand
foot and seven hundred horse. The French commander, Maréchal du Biez,
and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page414" name="page414"></a>(p. 414)</span>
his fourteen thousand men were surprised, and they left
their stores, their ammunition and their artillery in the hands of
their English
foes.<a id="footnotetag1138" name="footnotetag1138"></a><a href="#footnote1138">[1138]</a></p>

<p>Boulogne was safe for the time, but a French fleet entered the Solent,
and effected a landing at Bembridge. Skirmishing took place in the
wooded, undulating country between the shore and the slopes of
Bembridge Down; the English retreated and broke the bridge over the
Yar. This checked the French advance, though a force which was stopped
by that puny stream could not have been very determined. A day or two
later the French sent round a party to fill their water-casks at the
brook which trickles down Shanklin Chine; it was attacked and cut to
pieces.<a id="footnotetag1139" name="footnotetag1139"></a><a href="#footnote1139">[1139]</a>
They then proposed forcing their way into Portsmouth
Harbour, but the mill-race of the tide at its mouth, and the mysteries
of the sandbanks of Spithead deterred them; and, as a westerly breeze
sprang up, they dropped down before it along the Sussex coast. The
English had suffered a disaster by the sinking of the <i>Mary Rose</i> with
all hands on board, an accident repeated on the same spot two
centuries later, in the loss of the <i>Royal George</i>. But the Admiral,
Lisle, followed the French, and a slight action was fought off
Shoreham; the fleets anchored for the night almost within gunshot,
but, when dawn broke, the last French ship was hull-down on the
horizon. Disease had done more than the English arms, and the French
troops landed at the mouth of the Seine were the pitiful wreck of an
army.<a id="footnotetag1140" name="footnotetag1140"></a><a href="#footnote1140">[1140]</a></p>

<p>France could hope for little profit from a continuance of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page415" name="page415"></a>(p. 415)</span>
the war, and England had everything to gain by its conclusion. The
terms of peace were finally settled in June,
1546.<a id="footnotetag1141" name="footnotetag1141"></a><a href="#footnote1141">[1141]</a>
Boulogne was
to remain eight years in English hands, and France was then to pay
heavily for its restitution. Scotland was not included in the peace.
In September, 1545, Hertford had revenged the English defeat at Ancrum
Moor by a desolating raid on the
Borders;<a id="footnotetag1142" name="footnotetag1142"></a><a href="#footnote1142">[1142]</a>
early in 1546 Cardinal
Beton, the soul of the French party, was assassinated, not without
Henry's connivance; and St. Andrews was seized by a body of Scots
Protestants in alliance with England. Throughout the autumn
preparation was being made for a fresh attempt to enforce the marriage
between Edward and
Mary;<a id="footnotetag1143" name="footnotetag1143"></a><a href="#footnote1143">[1143]</a>
but the further prosecution of that
enterprise was reserved for other hands than those of Henry VIII. He
left the relations between England and Scotland in no better state
than he found them. His aggressive imperialism paid little heed to the
susceptibilities of a stubborn, if weaker, foe; and he did not, like
Cromwell, possess the military force to crush out resistance. He would
not conciliate and he could not coerce.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>Meanwhile, amid the distractions of his Scottish intrigues, of his
campaign in France, and of his defence of England, the King was
engaged in his last hopeless endeavour to secure unity and concord in
religious opinion. The ferocious Act of Six Articles had never been
more than fitfully executed; and Henry refrained from using to the
full the powers with which he had been entrusted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page416" name="page416"></a>(p. 416)</span>
by
Parliament. The fall of Catherine Howard may have impaired the
influence of her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, who had always expressed
his zeal for the burning of heretics; and the reforming party was
rapidly growing in the nation at large, and even within the guarded
precincts of the King's Privy Council. Cranmer retained his curious
hold over Henry's mind; Hertford was steadily rising in favour; Queen
Catherine Parr, so far as she dared, supported the New Learning; the
majority of the Council were prepared to accept the authorised form of
religion, whatever it might happen to be, and, besides the Howards,
Gardiner was the only convinced and determined champion of the
Catholic faith. Even at the moment of Cromwell's fall, there was no
intention of undoing anything that had already been done; Henry only
determined that things should not go so fast, especially in the way of
doctrinal change, as the Vicegerent wished, for he knew that unity was
not to be sought or found in that direction. But, between the extremes
of Lutheranism and the <i>status quo</i> in the Church, there was a good
deal to be done, in the way of reform, which was still consistent with
the maintenance of the Catholic faith. In May, 1541, a fresh
proclamation was issued for the use of the
Bible.<a id="footnotetag1144" name="footnotetag1144"></a><a href="#footnote1144">[1144]</a>
He had, said
the King, intended his subjects to read the Bible humbly and
reverently for their instruction, not reading aloud in time of Holy
Mass or other divine service, nor, being laymen, arguing thereon; but,
at the same time, he ordered all curates and parishioners who had
failed to obey his former injunctions to provide an English Bible for
their Church without delay. Two months later another proclamation
followed,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page417" name="page417"></a>(p. 417)</span>
regulating the number of saints' days; it was
characteristic of the age that various saints' days were abolished,
not so much for the purpose of checking superstition, as because they
interfered with the harvest and other secular
business.<a id="footnotetag1145" name="footnotetag1145"></a><a href="#footnote1145">[1145]</a>
Other
proclamations came forth in the same year for the destruction of
shrines and the removal of relics. In 1543 a general revision of
service-books was ordered, with a view to eradicating "false legends"
and references to saints not mentioned in the Bible, or in the
"authentical
doctors".<a id="footnotetag1146" name="footnotetag1146"></a><a href="#footnote1146">[1146]</a>
The Sarum Use was adopted as the standard
for the clergy of the province of Canterbury, and things were steadily
tending towards that ideal uniformity of service as well as of
doctrine, which was ultimately embodied in various Acts of Uniformity.
Homilies, "made by certain prelates," were submitted to Convocation,
but the publication of them, and of the rationale of rites and
ceremonies, was deferred to the reign of Edward
VI.<a id="footnotetag1147" name="footnotetag1147"></a><a href="#footnote1147">[1147]</a>
The greatest
of all these compositions, the Litany, was, however, sanctioned in
1545.<a id="footnotetag1148" name="footnotetag1148"></a><a href="#footnote1148">[1148]</a></p>

<p>The King had more to do with the <i>Necessary Doctrine</i>, commonly called
the "King's Book" to distinguish it from the Bishops' Book of 1537,
for which Henry had declined all responsibility. Henry, indeed, had
urged on its revision, he had fully discussed with Cranmer the
amendments he thought the book needed, and he had brought the bishops
to an agreement, which they had vainly sought for three years by
themselves. It was the King who now "set forth a true and perfect
doctrine for all his
people".<a id="footnotetag1149" name="footnotetag1149"></a><a href="#footnote1149">[1149]</a>
So it was fondly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page418" name="page418"></a>(p. 418)</span>
styled
by his Council. A modern
high-churchman<a id="footnotetag1150" name="footnotetag1150"></a><a href="#footnote1150">[1150]</a>
asserts that the King's
Book taught higher doctrine than the book which the bishops had
drafted six years before, but that "it was far more liberal and better
composed". Whether its excellences amounted to "a true and perfect
doctrine" or not, it failed of its purpose. The efforts of the old and
the new parties were perpetually driving the Church from the <i>Via
Media</i>, which Henry marked out. On the one hand, we have an act
limiting the use of the Bible to gentlemen and their families, and
plots to catch Cranmer in the meshes of the Six
Articles.<a id="footnotetag1151" name="footnotetag1151"></a><a href="#footnote1151">[1151]</a>
On the
other, there were schemes on the part of some of the Council to entrap
Gardiner, and we have Cranmer's
assertion<a id="footnotetag1152" name="footnotetag1152"></a><a href="#footnote1152">[1152]</a>
that, in the last
months of his reign, the King commanded him to pen a form for the
alteration of the Mass into a Communion, a design obviously to be
connected with the fact that, in his irritation at Charles's desertion
in 1544, and fear that his neutrality might become active hostility,
Henry had once more entered into communication with the Lutheran
princes of
Germany.<a id="footnotetag1153" name="footnotetag1153"></a><a href="#footnote1153">[1153]</a></p>

<p>The only ecclesiastical change that went on without shadow of turning
was the seizure of Church property by the King; and it is a matter of
curious speculation as to where he would have stayed his hand had he
lived much longer. The debasement of the coinage had proceeded apace
during his later years to supply the King's necessities,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page419" name="page419"></a>(p. 419)</span>
and, for the same purpose, Parliament, in 1545, granted him all
chantries, hospitals and free chapels. That session ended with Henry's
last appearance before his faithful Lords and Commons, and the speech
he then delivered may be regarded as his last political will and
testament.<a id="footnotetag1154" name="footnotetag1154"></a><a href="#footnote1154">[1154]</a>
He spoke, he said, instead of the Lord Chancellor,
"because he is not so able to open and set forth my mind and meaning,
and the secrets of my heart, in so plain and ample manner, as I myself
am and can do". He thanked his subjects for their commendation,
protested that he was "both bare and barren" of the virtues a prince
ought to have, but rendered to God "most humble thanks" for "such
small qualities as He hath indued me withal.... Now, since I find such
kindness in your part towards me, I cannot choose but love and favour
you; affirming that no prince in the world more favoureth his subjects
than I do you, nor no subjects or Commons more love and obey their
Sovereign Lord, than I perceive you do; for whose defence my treasure
shall not be hidden, nor my person shall not be unadventured. Yet,
although I wish you, and you wish me, to be in this perfect love and
concord, this friendly amity cannot continue, except both you, my
Lords Temporal and my Lords Spiritual, and you, my loving subjects,
study and take pains to amend one thing, which surely is amiss and far
out of order; to the which I most heartily require you. Which is, that
Charity and Concord is not amongst you, but Discord and Dissension
beareth rule in every place. Saint Paul saith to the Corinthians, the
thirteenth chapter, <i>Charity is gentle, Charity is not envious,</i>
<i>Charity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page420" name="page420"></a>(p. 420)</span>
is not proud</i>, and so forth. Behold then, what love
and charity is amongst you, when one calleth another heretic and
anabaptist, and he calleth him again papist, hypocrite and Pharisee?
Be these tokens of Charity amongst you? Are these signs of fraternal
love amongst you? No, no, I assure you that this lack of charity among
yourselves will be the hindrance and assuaging of the perfect love
betwixt us, except this wound be salved and clearly made whole.... I
hear daily that you of the Clergy preach one against another, without
charity or discretion; some be too stiff in their old <i>Mumpsimus</i>,
others be too busy and curious in their new <i>Sumpsimus</i>. Thus all men
almost be in variety and discord, and few or none preach truly and
sincerely the Word of God.... Yet the Temporalty be not clear and
unspotted of malice and envy. For you rail on Bishops, speak
slanderously of Priests, and rebuke and taunt preachers, both contrary
to good order and Christian fraternity. If you know surely that a
Bishop or Preacher erreth, or teacheth perverse doctrine, come and
declare it to some of our Council, or to us, to whom is committed by
God the high authority to reform such causes and behaviours. And be
not judges of yourselves of your fantastical opinions and vain
expositions.... I am very sorry to know and to hear how unreverently
that most precious jewel, the Word of God, is disputed, rhymed, sung,
and jangled in every Ale-house and Tavern.... And yet I am even as
much sorry that the readers of the same follow it in doing so faintly
and so coldly. For of this I am sure, that charity was never so faint
amongst you, and virtuous and godly living was never less used, nor
God Himself among Christians was never less reverenced, honoured,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page421" name="page421"></a>(p. 421)</span>
 or served. Therefore, as I said before, be in charity one with
another like brother and brother; love, dread, and serve God; to which
I,as your Supreme Head and Sovereign Lord, exhort and require you;
and then I doubt not but that love and league, that I spake of in the
beginning, shall never be dissolved or broke betwixt us."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p>The bond betwixt Henry and his subjects, which had lasted thirty-eight
years, and had survived such strain as has rarely been put on the
loyalty of any people, was now to be broken by death. The King was
able to make his usual progress in August and September, 1546; from
Westminster he went to Hampton Court, thence to Oatlands, Woking and
Guildford, and from Guildford to Chobham and Windsor, where he spent
the month of October. Early in November he came up to London, staying
first at Whitehall and then at Ely Place. From Ely Place he returned,
on the 3rd of January, 1547, to Whitehall, which he was never to leave
alive.<a id="footnotetag1155" name="footnotetag1155"></a><a href="#footnote1155">[1155]</a>
He is said to have become so unwieldy that he could
neither walk nor stand, and mechanical contrivances were used at
Windsor and his other palaces for moving the royal person from room to
room. His days were numbered and finished, and every one thought of
the morrow. A child of nine would reign, but who should rule? Hertford
or Norfolk? The party of reform or that of reaction? Henry had
apparently decided that neither should dominate the other, and
designed a balance of parties in the council he named for his
child-successor.<a id="footnotetag1156" name="footnotetag1156"></a><a href="#footnote1156">[1156]</a></p>

<p>Suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page422" name="page422"></a>(p. 422)</span>
the balance upset. On the 12th of December, 1546,
Norfolk and his son, the Earl of Surrey, were arrested for treason and
sent to the Tower. Endowed with great poetic gifts, Surrey had even
greater defects of character. Nine years before he had been known as
"the most foolish proud boy in
England".<a id="footnotetag1157" name="footnotetag1157"></a><a href="#footnote1157">[1157]</a>
Twice he had been
committed to prison by the Council for roaming the streets of the city
at night and breaking the citizens'
windows,<a id="footnotetag1158" name="footnotetag1158"></a><a href="#footnote1158">[1158]</a>
offences venial in
the exuberance of youth, but highly unbecoming in a man who was nearly
thirty, who aspired to high place in the councils of the realm, and
who despised most of his colleagues as upstarts. His enmity was
specially directed against the Prince's uncles, the Seymours. Hertford
had twice been called in to retrieve Surrey's military blunders.
Surrey made improper advances to Hertford's wife, but repudiated with
scorn his father's suggestion for a marriage alliance between the two
families.<a id="footnotetag1159" name="footnotetag1159"></a><a href="#footnote1159">[1159]</a>
His sister testified that he had advised her to become
the King's mistress, with a view to advancing the Howard interests.
Who, he asked, should be Protector, in case the King died, but his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page423" name="page423"></a>(p. 423)</span>
father? He quartered the royal arms with his own, in spite of
the heralds' prohibition. This at once roused Henry's suspicions; he
knew that, years before, Norfolk had been suggested as a possible
claimant to the throne, and that a marriage had been proposed between
Surrey and the Princess Mary.</p>

<p>The original charge against Surrey was prompted by personal and local
jealousy, not on the part of the Seymours, but on that of a member of
Surrey's own party. It came from Sir Richard Southwell, a Catholic and
a man of weight and leading in Norfolk, like the Howards themselves;
he even appears to have been brought up with Surrey, and for many
years had been intimate with the Howard family. When Surrey was called
before the Council to answer Southwell's charges, he wished to fight
his accuser, but both were committed to custody. The case was
investigated by the King himself, with the help of another Catholic,
Lord Chancellor Wriothesley. The Duke of Norfolk confessed to
technical treason in concealing his son's offences, and was sent to
the Tower. On the 13th of January, 1547, Surrey was found guilty by a
special commission sitting at the
Guildhall;<a id="footnotetag1160" name="footnotetag1160"></a><a href="#footnote1160">[1160]</a>
a week later he was
beheaded.<a id="footnotetag1161" name="footnotetag1161"></a><a href="#footnote1161">[1161]</a>
On the 18th Parliament met to deal with the Duke; by
the 24th a bill of attainder had passed all its stages and awaited
only the King's assent. On Thursday, the 27th, that assent was given
by royal
commission.<a id="footnotetag1162" name="footnotetag1162"></a><a href="#footnote1162">[1162]</a>
Orders are said to have been issued for the
Duke's execution the following morning.</p>

<p>That night Norfolk lay doomed in his cell in the Tower,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page424" name="page424"></a>(p. 424)</span>
and
Henry VIII. in his palace at Westminster. The Angel of Death hovered
over the twain, doubting which to take. Eighteen years before, the
King had said that, were his will opposed, there was never so noble a
head in his kingdom but he would make it
fly.<a id="footnotetag1163" name="footnotetag1163"></a><a href="#footnote1163">[1163]</a>
Now his own hour
was come, and he was loth to hear of death. His physicians dared not
breathe the word, for to prophesy the King's decease was treason by
Act of Parliament. As that long Thursday evening wore on, Sir Anthony
Denny, chief gentleman of the chamber, "boldly coming to the King,
told him what case he was in, to man's judgment not like to live; and
therefore exhorted him to prepare himself to
death".<a id="footnotetag1164" name="footnotetag1164"></a><a href="#footnote1164">[1164]</a>
Sensible of
his weakness, Henry "disposed himself more quietly to hearken to the
words of his exhortation, and to consider his life past; which
although he much abused, 'yet,' said he, 'is the mercy of Christ able
to pardon me all my sins, though they were greater than they be'".
Denny then asked if he should send for "any learned man to confer
withal and to open his mind unto". The King replied that if he had any
one, it should be Cranmer; but first he would "take a little sleep;
and then, as I feel myself, I will advise upon the matter". And while
he slept, Hertford and Paget paced the gallery outside, contriving to
grasp the reins of power as they fell from their master's
hands.<a id="footnotetag1165" name="footnotetag1165"></a><a href="#footnote1165">[1165]</a>
When the King woke he felt his feebleness growing upon him, and told
Denny to send for Cranmer. The Archbishop came about midnight: Henry
was speechless, and almost unconscious. He stretched out
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page425" name="page425"></a>(p. 425)</span>
his
hand to Cranmer, and held him fast, while the Archbishop exhorted him
to give some token that he put his trust in Christ. The King wrung
Cranmer's hand with his fast-ebbing strength, and so passed away about
two in the morning, on Friday, the 28th of January, 1547. He was
exactly fifty-five years and seven months old, and his reign had
lasted for thirty-seven years and three-quarters.</p>

<p>"And for my body," wrote Henry in his
will,<a id="footnotetag1166" name="footnotetag1166"></a><a href="#footnote1166">[1166]</a>
"which when the soul
is departed, shall then remain but as a <i>cadaver</i>, and so return to
the vile matter it was made of, were it not for the crown and dignity
which God hath called us unto, and that We would not be counted an
infringer of honest worldly policies and customs, when they be not
contrary to God's laws, We would be content to have it buried in any
place accustomed to Christian folks, were it never so vile, for it is
but ashes, and to ashes it shall return. Nevertheless, because We
would be loth, in the reputation of the people, to do injury to the
Dignity, which We are unworthily called unto, We are content to will
and order that Our body be buried and interred in the choir of Our
college of Windsor." On the 8th of February, in every parish church in
the realm, there was sung a solemn dirge by night, with all the bells
ringing, and on the morrow a Requiem mass for the soul of the
King.<a id="footnotetag1167" name="footnotetag1167"></a><a href="#footnote1167">[1167]</a>
Six days later his body "was solemnly with great honour
conveyed in a chariot towards Windsor," and the funeral procession
stretched four miles
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page426" name="page426"></a>(p. 426)</span>
along the roads. That night the body
lay at Sion under a hearse, nine storeys high. On the 15th it was
taken to Windsor, where it was met by the Dean and choristers of the
Chapel Royal, and by the members of Eton College. There in the castle
it rested under a hearse of thirteen storeys; and on the morrow it was
buried, after mass, in the choir of St. George's Chapel.</p>

<p>Midway between the stalls and the Altar the tomb of Queen Jane Seymour
was opened to receive the bones of her lord. Hard by stood that
mausoleum "more costly than any royal or papal monument in the
world,"<a id="footnotetag1168" name="footnotetag1168"></a><a href="#footnote1168">[1168]</a>
which Henry VII. had commenced as a last resting-place
for himself and his successors, but had abandoned for his chapel in
Westminster Abbey. His son bestowed the building on Wolsey, who
prepared for his own remains a splendid cenotaph of black and white
marble. On the Cardinal's fall Henry VIII. designed both tomb and
chapel for himself <i>post multos et felices
annos</i>.<a id="footnotetag1169" name="footnotetag1169"></a><a href="#footnote1169">[1169]</a>
But King and
Cardinal reaped little honour by these strivings after posthumous
glory. The dying commands of the monarch, whose will had been
omnipotent during his life, remained unfulfilled; the memorial chapel
was left incomplete; and the monument of marble was taken down,
despoiled of its ornaments and sold in the Great Rebellion. At length,
in a happier age, after more than three centuries of neglect, the
magnificent building was finished, but not in Henry's honour; it was
adorned and dedicated to the memory of a prince in whose veins there
flowed not a drop of Henry's blood.</p>




<h3>CHAPTER XVI.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page427" name="page427"></a>(p. 427)</span>
</h3>

<h4>CONCLUSION.</h4>


<p>So died and so was buried the most remarkable man who ever sat on the
English throne. His reign, like his character, seems to be divided
into two inconsistent halves. In 1519 his rule is pronounced more
suave and gentle than the greatest liberty anywhere else; twenty years
later terror is said to reign supreme. It is tempting to sum up his
life in one sweeping generalisation, and to say that it exhibits a
continuous development of Henry's intellect and deterioration of his
character. Yet it is difficult to read the King's speech in Parliament
at the close of 1545, without crediting him with some sort of ethical
ideas and aims; his life was at least as free from vice during the
last, as during the first, seven years of his reign; in seriousness of
purpose and steadfastness of aim it was immeasurably superior; and at
no time did Henry's moral standard vary greatly from that of many whom
the world is content to regard as its heroes. His besetting sin was
egotism, a sin which princes can hardly, and Tudors could nowise,
avoid. Of egotism Henry had his full share from the beginning; at
first it moved in a limited, personal sphere, but gradually it
extended its scope till it comprised the whole realm of national
religion and policy.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page428" name="page428"></a>(p. 428)</span>
The obstacles which he encountered in
prosecuting his suit for a divorce from Catherine of Aragon were the
first check he experienced in the gratification of a personal whim,
and the effort to remove those impediments drew him on to the
world-wide stage of the conflict with Rome. He was ever proceeding
from the particular to the general, from an attack on a special
dispensation to an attack on the dispensing power of the Pope, and
thence to an assault on the whole edifice of papal claims. He started
with no desire to separate England from Rome, or to reform the
Anglican Church; those aims he adopted, little by little, as
subsidiary to the attainment of his one great personal purpose. He
arrived at his principles by a process of deduction from his own
particular case.</p>

<p>As Henry went on, his "quick and penetrable eyes," as More described
them, were more and more opened to the extent of what he could do; and
he realised, as he said, how small was the power of the Pope. Papal
authority had always depended on moral influence and not on material
resources. That moral influence had long been impaired; the sack of
Rome in 1527 afforded further demonstration of its impotence; and,
when Clement condoned that outrage, and formed a close alliance with
the chief offender, the Papacy suffered a blow from which it never
recovered. Temporal princes might continue to recognise the Pope's
authority, but it was only because they chose, and not because they
were compelled so to do; they supported him, not as the divinely
commissioned Vicar of Christ, but as a useful instrument in the
prosecution of their own and their people's desires. It is called a
theological age, but it was also irreligious, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page429" name="page429"></a>(p. 429)</span>
its
principal feature was secularisation. National interests had already
become the dominant factor in European politics; they were no longer
to be made subservient to the behests of the universal Church. The
change was tacitly or explicitly recognised everywhere; and <i>cujus
regio, ejus religio</i> was the principle upon which German
ecclesiastical politics were based at the Peace of Augsburg. It was
assumed that each prince could do what he liked in his own country;
they might combine to make war on an excommunicate king, but only if
war suited their secular policy; and the rivalry between Francis and
Charles was so keen, that each set greater store upon Henry's help
than upon his destruction.</p>

<p>Thus the breach with Rome was made a possible, though not an easy,
task; and Henry was left to settle the matter at home with little to
fear from abroad, except threats which he knew to be empty. England
was the key of the situation, and in England must be sought the chief
causes of Henry's success. If we are to believe that Henry's policy
was at variance with the national will, his reign must remain a
political mystery, and we can offer no explanation of the facts that
Henry was permitted to do his work at all, and that it has stood so
long the test of time. He had, no doubt, exceptional facilities for
getting his way. His dictatorship was the child of the Wars of the
Roses, and his people, conscious of the fact that Henry was their only
bulwark against the recurrence of civil strife, and bound up as they
were in commercial and industrial pursuits, were willing to bear with
a much more arbitrary government than they would have been in less
perilous times. The alternatives may have been evil, but the choice
was freely made. No government,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page430" name="page430"></a>(p. 430)</span>
whatever its form, whatever
its resources, can permanently resist the national will; every nation
has, roughly speaking, the government it deserves and desires, and a
popular vote would never in Henry's reign have decreed his deposition.
The popular mind may be ill-informed, distorted by passion and
prejudice, and formed on selfish motives. Temporarily, too, the
popular will may be neutralised by skilful management on the part of
the government, by dividing its enemies and counterworking their
plans; and of all those arts Henry was a past master. But such
expedients cannot prevail in the end; in 1553 the Duke of
Northumberland had a subtle intellect and all the machinery of Tudor
government at his disposal; Queen Mary had not a man, nor a shilling.
Yet Mary, by popular favour, prevailed without shedding a drop of
blood. Henry himself was often compelled to yield to his people.
Abject self-abasement on their part and stupendous power of will on
Henry's, together provide no adequate solution for the history of his
reign.</p>

<p>With all his self-will, Henry was never blind to the distinction
between what he could and what he could not do. Strictly speaking, he
was a constitutional king; he neither attempted to break up
Parliament, nor to evade the law. He combined in his royal person the
parts of despot and demagogue, and both he clothed in Tudor grace and
majesty. He led his people in the way they wanted to go, he tempted
them with the baits they coveted most, he humoured their prejudices
against the clergy and against the pretensions of Rome, and he used
every concession to extract some fresh material for building up his
own authority. He owed his strength to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page431" name="page431"></a>(p. 431)</span>
the skill with which
he appealed to the weaknesses of a people, whose prevailing
characteristics were a passion for material prosperity and an absolute
indifference to human suffering. "We," wrote one of Henry's
Secretaries of State, "we, which talk much of Christ and His Holy
Word, have, I fear me, used a much contrary way; for we leave fishing
of men, and fish again in the tempestuous seas of this world for gain
and wicked
Mammon."<a id="footnotetag1170" name="footnotetag1170"></a><a href="#footnote1170">[1170]</a>
A few noble examples, Catholic and
Protestant, redeemed, by their blood, the age from complete
condemnation, but, in the mass of his subjects, the finer feelings
seem to have been lost in the pursuit of wealth. There is no sign that
the hideous tortures inflicted on men condemned for treason, or the
equally horrible sufferings of heretics burnt at the stake, excited
the least qualm of compassion in the breast of the multitude; the Act
of Six Articles seems to have been rather a popular measure, and the
multiplication of treasons evoked no national protest.</p>

<p>Henry, indeed, was the typical embodiment of an age that was at once
callous and full of national vigour, and his failings were as much a
source of strength as his virtues. His defiance of the conscience of
Europe did him no harm in England, where the splendid isolation of
<i>Athanasius contra mundum</i> is always a popular attitude; and even his
bitterest foes could scarce forbear to admire the dauntless front he
presented to every peril. National pride was the highest motive to
which he appealed. For the rest, he based his power on his people's
material interests, and not on their moral instincts. He took no such
hold of the ethical nature of men as did Oliver Cromwell,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page432" name="page432"></a>(p. 432)</span>
but he was liked none the less for that; for the nation regarded
Cromwell, the man of God, with much less favour than Charles II., the
man of sin; and statesmen who try to rule on exclusively moral
principles are seldom successful and seldom beloved. Henry's
successor, Protector Somerset, made a fine effort to introduce some
elements of humanity into the spirit of government; but he perished on
the scaffold, while his colleagues denounced his gentleness and love
of liberty, and declared that his repeal of Henry's savage
treason-laws was the worst deed done in their
generation.<a id="footnotetag1171" name="footnotetag1171"></a><a href="#footnote1171">[1171]</a></p>

<p>The King avoided the error of the Protector; he was neither behind nor
before the average man of the time; he appealed to the mob, and the
mob applauded. <i>Salus populi</i>, he said in effect, <i>suprema lex</i>, and
the people agreed; for that is a principle which suits demagogues no
less than despots, though they rarely possess Henry's skill in working
it out. Henry, it is true, modified the maxim slightly by substituting
prince for people, and by practising, before it was preached, Louis
XIV.'s doctrine that <i>L'État, c'est moi</i>. But the assumption that the
welfare of the people was bound up with that of their King was no idle
pretence; it was based on solid facts, the force of which the people
themselves admitted. They endorsed the tyrant's plea of necessity. The
pressure of foreign rivalries, and the fear of domestic disruption,
convinced Englishmen of the need for despotic rule, and no
consideration whatever was allowed to interfere with the stability of
government; individual rights and even the laws themselves must be
overridden, if they conflicted with the interests of the State.
Torture was illegal in England,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page433" name="page433"></a>(p. 433)</span>
and men were proud of the
fact, yet, in cases of treason, when the national security was thought
to be involved, torture was freely used, and it was used by the very
men who boasted of England's immunity. They were conscious of no
inconsistency; the common law was very well as a general rule, but the
highest law of all was the welfare of the State.</p>

<p>This was the real tyranny of Tudor times; men were dominated by the
idea that the State was the be-all and end-all of human existence. In
its early days the State is a child; it has no will and no ideas of
its own, and its first utterances are merely imitation and repetition.
But by Henry VIII.'s reign the State in England had grown to lusty
manhood; it dismissed its governess, the Church, and laid claim to
that omnipotence and absolute sovereignty which Hobbes regretfully
expounded in his
<i>Leviathan</i>.<a id="footnotetag1172" name="footnotetag1172"></a><a href="#footnote1172">[1172]</a>
The idea supplied an excuse to
despots and an inspiration to noble minds. "Surely," wrote a genuine
patriot in
1548,<a id="footnotetag1173" name="footnotetag1173"></a><a href="#footnote1173">[1173]</a>
"every honest man ought to refuse no pains, no
travail, no study, he ought to care for no reports, no slanders, no
displeasure, no envy, no malice, so that he might profit the
commonwealth of his country, for whom next after God he is created."
The service of the State tended, indeed, to encroach on the service of
God, and to obliterate altogether respect for individual liberty.
Wolsey on his death-bed was visited by qualms of conscience, but, as a
rule, victims to the principle afford,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page434" name="page434"></a>(p. 434)</span>
by their dying words,
the most striking illustrations of the omnipotence of the idea.
Condemned traitors are concerned on the scaffold, not to assert their
innocence, but to proclaim their readiness to die as an example of
obedience to the law. However unfair the judicial methods of Tudor
times may seem to us, the sufferers always thank the King for granting
them free trial. Their guilt or innocence is a matter of little
moment; the one thing needful is that no doubt should be thrown on the
inviolability of the will of the State; and the audience commend them.
They are not expected to confess or to express contrition, but merely
to submit to the decrees of the nation; if they do that, they are said
to make a charitable and godly end, and they deserve the respect and
sympathy of men; if not, they die uncharitably, and are held up to
reprobation.<a id="footnotetag1174" name="footnotetag1174"></a><a href="#footnote1174">[1174]</a>
To an age like that there was nothing strange in
the union of State
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page435" name="page435"></a>(p. 435)</span>
and Church and the supremacy of the King
over both; men professed Christianity in various forms, but to all men
alike the State was their real religion, and the King was their great
High Priest. The sixteenth century, and especially the reign of Henry
VIII., supplies the most vivid illustration of the working, both for
good and for evil, of the theory that the individual should be
subordinate in goods, in life and in conscience to the supreme
dictates of the national will. This theory was put into practice by
Henry VIII. long before it was made the basis of any political
philosophy, just as he practised Erastianism before Erastus gave it a
name.</p>


<p>The devotion paid to the State in Tudor times inevitably made
expediency, and not justice or morality, the supreme test of public
acts. The dictates of expediency were, indeed, clothed in legal forms,
but laws are primarily intended to secure neither justice nor
morality, but the interests of the State; and the highest penalty
known to the law is inflicted for high treason, a legal and political
crime which does not necessarily involve any breach whatever of the
code of morals. Traitors are not executed because they are immoral,
but because they are dangerous. Never did a more innocent head fall on
the scaffold than that of Lady Jane Grey; never was an execution more
fully justified by the law. The contrast was almost as flagrant in
many a State trial in the reign of Henry VIII.; no king was so careful
of law,<a id="footnotetag1175" name="footnotetag1175"></a><a href="#footnote1175">[1175]</a>
but he was not so careful of justice. Therein lay his
safety, for the law takes no cognisance of injustice, unless the
injustice is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page436" name="page436"></a>(p. 436)</span>
also a breach of the law, and Henry rarely, if
ever, broke the law. Not only did he keep the law, but he contrived
that the nation should always proclaim the legality of his conduct.
Acts of attainder, his favourite weapon, are erroneously supposed to
have been the method to which he resorted for removing opponents whose
conviction he could not obtain by a legal trial. But acts of attainder
were, as a rule, supplements to, not substitutes for, trials by
jury;<a id="footnotetag1176" name="footnotetag1176"></a><a href="#footnote1176">[1176]</a>
many were passed against the dead, whose goods had already
been forfeited to the King as the result of judicial verdicts.
Moreover, convictions were always easier to obtain from juries than
acts of attainder from Parliament. It was simplicity itself to pack a
jury of twelve, and even a jury of peers; but it was a much more
serious matter to pack both Houses of Parliament. What then was the
meaning and use of acts of attainder? They were acts of indemnity for
the King. People might cavil at the verdict of juries; for they were
only the decisions of a handful of men; but who should impugn the
voice of the whole body politic expressed in its most solemn, complete
and legal form? There is no way, said Francis to Henry in 1532, so
safe as by
Parliament,<a id="footnotetag1177" name="footnotetag1177"></a><a href="#footnote1177">[1177]</a>
and one of Henry's invariable methods
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page437" name="page437"></a>(p. 437)</span>
was to make the whole nation, so far as he could, his
accomplice. For pardons and acts of grace the King was ready to assume
the responsibility; but the nation itself must answer for rigorous
deeds. And acts of attainder were neither more nor less than
deliberate pronouncements, on the part of the people, that it was
expedient that one man should die rather than that the whole nation
should perish or run any risk of danger.</p>

<p>History, in a democratic age, tends to become a series of popular
apologies, and is inclined to assume that the people can do no wrong;
some one must be the scapegoat for the people's sins, and the national
sins of Henry's reign are all laid on Henry's shoulders. But the
nation in the sixteenth century deliberately condoned injustice, when
injustice made for its peace. It has done so before and after, and may
possibly do so again. It is easy in England to-day to denounce the
cruel sacrifices imposed on individuals in the time of Henry VIII. by
their subordination in everything to the interests of the State; but,
whenever and wherever like dangers have threatened, recourse has been
had to similar methods, to government by proclamation, to martial law,
and to verdicts based on political expediency.</p>

<p>The contrast between morals and politics, which comes out in Henry's
reign as a terrible contradiction, is inherent in all forms of human
society. Politics, the action of men in the mass, are akin to the
operation of natural forces; and, as such, they are neither moral nor
immoral; they are simply non-moral. Political movements are often as
resistless as the tides of the ocean; they carry to fortune, and they
bear to ruin, the just and the unjust with heedless impartiality. Cato
and Brutus striving against
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page438" name="page438"></a>(p. 438)</span>
the torrent of Roman
imperialism, Fisher and More seeking to stem the secularisation of the
Church, are like those who would save men's lives from the avalanche
by preaching to the mountain on the text of the sixth commandment. The
efforts of good men to avert a sure but cruel fate are the truest
theme of the Tragic Muse; and it is possible to represent Henry's
reign as one long nightmare of "truth for ever on the scaffold, wrong
for ever on the throne"; for Henry VIII. embodied an inevitable
movement of politics, while Fisher and More stood only for individual
conscience.</p>

<p>That is the secret of Henry's success. He directed the storm of a
revolution which was doomed to come, which was certain to break those
who refused to bend, and which may be explained by natural causes, but
cannot be judged by moral considerations. The storm cleared the air
and dissipated many a pestilent vapour, but it left a trail of wreck
and ruin over the land. The nation purchased political salvation at
the price of moral debasement; the individual was sacrificed on the
altar of the State; and popular subservience proved the impossibility
of saving a people from itself. Constitutional guarantees are
worthless without the national will to maintain them; men lightly
abandon what they lightly hold; and, in Henry's reign, the English
spirit of independence burned low in its socket, and love of freedom
grew cold. The indifference of his subjects to political issues
tempted Henry along the path to tyranny, and despotic power developed
in him features, the repulsiveness of which cannot be concealed by the
most exquisite art, appealing to the most deep-rooted prejudice. He
turned to his own profit the needs and the faults of his people, as
well as their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page439" name="page439"></a>(p. 439)</span>
national spirit. He sought the greatness of
England, and he spared no toil in the quest; but his labours were
spent for no ethical purpose. His aims were selfish; his realm must be
strong, because he must be great. He had the strength of a lion, and
like a lion he used it.</p>

<p>Yet it is probable that Henry's personal influence and personal action
averted greater evils than those they provoked. Without him, the storm
of the Reformation would still have burst over England; without him,
it might have been far more terrible. Every drop of blood shed under
Henry VIII. might have been a river under a feebler king. Instead of a
stray execution here and there, conducted always with a scrupulous
regard for legal forms, wars of religion might have desolated the land
and swept away thousands of lives. London saw many a hideous sight in
Henry's reign, but it had no cause to envy the Catholic capitals which
witnessed the sack of Rome and the massacre of St. Bartholomew; for
all Henry's iniquities, multiplied manifold, would not equal the
volume of murder and sacrilege wrought at Rome in May, 1527, or at
Paris in August,
1572.<a id="footnotetag1178" name="footnotetag1178"></a><a href="#footnote1178">[1178]</a>
From such orgies of violence and crime,
England was saved by the strong right arm and the iron will of her
Tudor king. "He is," said Wolsey after his
fall,<a id="footnotetag1179" name="footnotetag1179"></a><a href="#footnote1179">[1179]</a>
"a prince of
royal courage, and he hath a princely heart; and rather than he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page440" name="page440"></a>(p. 440)</span>
will miss or want part of his appetite he will hazard the loss of
one-half of his kingdom." But Henry discerned more clearly than Wolsey
the nature of the ground on which he stood; by accident, or by design,
his appetite conformed to potent and permanent forces; and, wherein it
did not, he was, in spite of Wolsey's remark, content to forgo its
gratification. It was not he, but the Reformation, which put the
kingdoms of Europe to the hazard. The Sphinx propounded her riddle to
all nations alike, and all were required to answer. Should they cleave
to the old, or should they embrace the new? Some pressed forward,
others held back, and some, to their own confusion, replied in dubious
tones. Surrounded by faint hearts and fearful minds, Henry VIII.
neither faltered nor failed. He ruled in a ruthless age with a
ruthless hand, he dealt with a violent crisis by methods of blood and
iron, and his measures were crowned with whatever sanction worldly
success can give. He is Machiavelli's <i>Prince</i> in action. He took his
stand on efficiency rather than principle, and symbolised the
prevailing of the gates of Hell. The spiritual welfare of England
entered into his thoughts, if at all, as a minor consideration; but,
for her peace and material comfort it was well that she had as her
King, in her hour of need, a man, and a man who counted the cost, who
faced the risk, and who did with his might whatsoever his hand found
to do.</p>

<b>Footnote 2:</b> This series, unlike the <i>Calendars of State Papers</i>,
includes documents not preserved at the Record Office; it is often
inaccurately cited as <i>Calendar of State Papers</i>, but the word
"Calendar" does not appear in the title and it includes much besides
State papers; such a description also tends to confuse it with the
eleven volumes of Henry VIII.'s State papers published <i>in extenso</i> in
1830-51. The series now extends to Dec., 1544, and is cited in the
text as <i>L. and P.</i><a href="#footnotetag2">(back)</a></p>

of this edition added references to the original sources&mdash;a task
of some labour when nearly every fact is taken from a different

<b>Footnote 311:</b> Brewer (Henry VIII., ii., 388; <i>L. and P.</i>, vol. iv.,
Introd., p. dxxxv. <i>n.</i>) is very indignant at this allegation, and
when recording Chapuys' statement in 1529 that Pace had been
imprisoned for two years in the Tower and elsewhere by Wolsey,
declares that "Pace was never committed to the Tower, nor kept in
prison by Wolsey" but was "placed under the charge of the Bishop of
Bangor," and that Chapuys' statement is "an instance how popular
rumour exaggerates facts, or how Spanish ambassadors were likely to
misrepresent them". It is rather an instance of the lengths to which
Brewer's zeal for Wolsey carried him. He had not seen the despatch
from Mendoza recording Pace's committal to the Tower on 25th Oct.,
1527, "for speaking to the King in opposition to Wolsey and the
divorce" (<i>Sp. Cal.</i>, 1527-29, p. 440). It is true that Pace was in
the charge of the Bishop of Bangor, but he was not transferred thither
until 1528 (Ellis, <i>Orig. Letters</i>, 3rd ser., ii., 151); he was
released immediately upon Wolsey's fall. Erasmus, thereupon,
congratulating him on the fact, remarked that he was consoled by
Pace's experience for his own persecution and that God rescued the
innocent and cast down the proud (<i>ibid.</i>, iv., 6283). The <i>D.N.B.</i>
(xliii., 24), has been misled by Brewer. Wolsey had long had a grudge
against Pace, and in 1514 was anxious to make "a fearful example" of
him (<i>L. and P.</i>, i., 5465); and his treatment of Pace was one of the
charges brought against him in 1529 (<i>ibid.</i>, iv., p. 2552).<a href="#footnotetag311">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 554:</b> Dr. Gairdner (<i>Engl. Hist. Rev.</i>, xi., 675) speaks of

are these: (1) an undated letter (<i>L. and P.</i>, iv., App. 105)
announcing the ambassador's arrival in England; (2) a letter of 21st
March (iv., 2974); (3) a brief note of no importance to Dr. Brienne,
dated 2nd April (<i>ibid.</i>, 3012); (4) the formal commission of Francis
I., dated 13th April (<i>ibid.</i>, 3059); (5) the treaty of 30th April
(3080); and (6) three brief notes from Turenne to Montmorenci, dated

<b>Footnote 556:</b> "There will be great difficulty," wrote Clerk, "<i>circa
istud benedictum divortium</i>." Brewer interpreted this as the earliest
reference to Henry's divorce; it was really, as Dr. Ehses shows, in
reference to the dissolution of the precontract between Francis I. and
Charles V.'s sister Eleanor (<i>Engl. Hist. Rev.</i>, xi., 676).<a href="#footnotetag556">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 558:</b> <i>Ibid.</i>, iv., 4231, 4942. Henry's own account of the
matter was as follows: "For some years past he had noticed in reading
the Bible the severe penalty inflicted by God on those who married the
relicts of their brothers"; he at length "began to be troubled in his
conscience, and to regard the sudden deaths of his male children as a
Divine judgment. The more he studied the matter, the more clearly it
appeared to him that he had broken a Divine law. He then called to
counsel men learned in pontifical law, to ascertain their opinion of
the dispensation. Some pronounced it invalid. So far he had proceeded
as secretly as possible that he might do nothing rashly" (<i>L. and P.</i>,
iv., 5156; <i>cf.</i> iv., 3641). Shakespeare, following Cavendish (p.
221), makes Henry reveal his doubts first to his confessor, Bishop
Longland of Lincoln: "First I began in private with you, my Lord of
Lincoln" ("Henry VIII.," Act II., sc. iv.); and there is contemporary
authority for this belief. In 1532 Longland was said to have suggested
a divorce to Henry ten years previously (<i>L. and P.</i>, v., 1114), and
Chapuys termed him "the principal promoter of these practices"
(<i>ibid.</i>, v., 1046); and in 1536 the northern rebels thought that he
was the beginning of all the trouble (<i>ibid.</i>, xi., 705); the same
assertion is made in the anonymous "Life and Death of Cranmer" (<i>Narr.
of the Reformation</i>, Camden Soc., p. 219). Other persons to whom the
doubtful honour was ascribed are Wolsey and Stafileo, Dean of the Rota
at Rome (<i>L. and P.</i>, iv., 3400; <i>Sp. Cal.</i>, iv., 159).<a href="#footnotetag558">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 704:</b> It has been alleged that the immediate object of this
Parliament was to relieve the King from the necessity of repaying the
loan (<i>D.N.B.</i>, xxvi., 83); and much scorn has been poured on the
notion that it had any important purpose (<i>L. and P.</i>, iv., Introd.,
p. dcxlvii.). Brewer even denies its hostility to the Church on the
ground that it was composed largely of lawyers, and "lawyers are not
in general enemies to things established; they are not inimical to the
clergy". Yet the law element was certainly stronger in the Parliaments
of Charles I. than in that of 1529; were they not hostile to "things
established" and "inimical to the clergy"? Contemporaries had a
different opinion of the purpose of the Parliament of 1529. "It is
intended," wrote Du Bellay on the 23rd of August, three months before
Parliament met, "to hold a Parliament here this winter and act by
their own absolute power, in default of justice being administered by
the Pope in this divorce" (<i>ibid.</i>, iv., 5862; <i>cf.</i> iv., 6011, 6019,
6307); "nothing else," wrote a Florentine in December, 1530, "is
thought of in that island every day except of arranging affairs in
such a way that they do no longer be in want of the Pope, neither for
filling vacancies in the Church, nor for any other purpose" (<i>ibid.</i>,

<b>Footnote 718:</b> This seems to have been the object of Southampton's
tour through the constituencies of Surrey and Hampshire in March,
1539; with one of Gardiner's pocket-boroughs he did not meddle,
because the lord chamberlain was the Bishop's steward there (<i>L. and
P.</i>, xiv., i., 520). There were some royal nominees in the House of
Commons. In 1523 the members for Cumberland were nominated by the
Crown (<i>ibid.</i>, iii., 2931); at Calais the lord-deputy and council
elected one of the two burgesses and the mayor and burgesses the other
(<i>ibid.</i>, x., 736). Calais and the Scottish Borders were of course
exceptionally under Crown influence, but this curious practice may
have been observed in some other cities and boroughs; in 1534, for
instance, the King was to nominate to one of the two vacancies at
Worcester (<i>ibid.</i>, vii., 56).<a href="#footnotetag718">(back)</a></p>

urged "the more speedy dissolution"; then for fourteen years there was
only one Parliament, that of 1523. These dates illustrate the
antagonism between Wolsey and Parliament and show how natural it was

to poison members of Sir James Worsley's household, and on 27th

so to speak the election petitions of the defeated party; the chief
complaint is that non-residents were chosen who knew little about the
needs of their constituents, and they made the advanced demand that
all King's servants or pensioners be excluded.</p>

<p>The most striking instance of interference in elections is Cromwell's
letter to the citizens of Canterbury, written on 18th May, 1536, and
first printed in Merriman's <i>Cromwell</i>, 1902, ii., 13; he there
requires the electors to annul an election they had made in defiance
of previous letters, and return as members Robert Derknall (a member
of the royal household, <i>L. and P.</i>, xv., pp. 563-5) and John Brydges,
M.P. for Canterbury in 1529-36, instead of the two who had been
unanimously chosen by eighty electors on 11th May (<i>L. and P.</i>, x.,
852). The Mayor thereupon assembled ninety-seven citizens who "freely
with one voice and without any contradiction elected the aforesaid"
(<i>ibid.</i>, x., 929). These very letters show that electors did exercise
a vote, and the fact that from 1534 to 1539 we find traces of pressure
being put upon them, affords some presumption that before the rise of
Cromwell, when we find no such traces no such pressure was exerted.
The most striking exception must not be taken as the rule. See p.

<b>Footnote 733:</b> "Parliament," says Brewer, "faithfully reflected the
King's wishes." It is equally true to say that the King reflected the
wishes of Parliament; and the accusation of servility is based on the
assumption that Parliament must either be in chronic opposition to the
Crown or servile. One of Brewer's reasons for Henry's power is that he
"required no grants of money"! (<i>L. and P.</i>, iv., Introd., p.

<b>Footnote 735:</b> Cromwell used to report to the King on the feeling of
Parliament; thus in 1534 (<i>L. and P.</i>, vii., 51) he tells Henry how
far members were willing to go in the creation of fresh treasons,
"they be contented that deed and writing shall be treason," but words
were to be only misprision; they refused to include an heir's
rebellion or disobedience in the bill, "as rebellion is already
treason and disobedience is no cause of forfeiture of inheritance,"
and they thought "that the King of Scots should in no wise be named"
(there is in the Record Office a draft of the Treasons Bill of 1534
materially differing from the Act as passed. Therefore either the bill
did not originate with the Government and was modified under
Government pressure, or it did originate with the Government and was
modified under parliamentary pressure). This is how Henry's
legislation was evolved; there is no foundation for the assertion that
Parliament merely registered the King's edicts.<a href="#footnotetag735">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 770:</b> That it passed at all is often considered proof of
parliamentary servility; it is rather an illustration of the typical
Tudor policy of burdening the wealthy few in order to spare the
general public. If repayment of the loan were exacted, fresh taxation
would be necessary, which would fall on many more than had lent the
King money. It was very irregular, but the burden was thus placed on
the shoulders of those individuals who benefited most by Henry's
ecclesiastical and general policy and were rapidly accumulating
wealth. Taxation on the whole was remarkably light during Tudor times;
the tenths, fifteenths and subsidies had become fixed sums which did
not increase with the national wealth, and indeed brought in less and
less to the royal exchequer (see <i>L. and P.</i>, vii., 344,
"considerations why subsidies in diverse shires were not so good in
Henry's seventh year as in his fifth"; <i>cf.</i> vii., 1490, and xix.,

Chapuys, "between the nuncio and me that he should go to the said
ecclesiastics in their congregation and recommend them to support the
immunity of the Church.... They were all utterly astonished and
scandalised, and without allowing him to open his mouth they begged
him to leave them in peace, for they had not the King's leave to speak
with him."<a href="#footnotetag792">(back)</a></p>

the honour caused further delays. The bull of excommunication was

Henry of his kingdom was sanctioned, printed and prepared for
publication (x., Introd., p. xv., Nos. 82, 107), but first Francis and

III., now that he, Charles and Francis were united in the bond of

praised her in Anne's presence. At the worst Henry's manners were
generally polite; on one occasion, writes Chapuys, "when the King was
going to mount his horse, the Princess went on to a terrace at the top
of the house to see him. The King, either being told of it or by
chance, turned round, and seeing her on her knees with her hands
joined, bowed to her and put his hand to his hat. Then all those
present who had not dared to raise their heads to look at her [surely
they may not have seen her] rejoiced at what the King had done, and
saluted her reverently with signs of good-will and compassion"

<b>Footnote 898:</b> <i>L. and P.</i>, vi., 1382; vii., 56. A whole essay might
be written on this latter brief document; it is not, what it purports
to be, a list of knights of the shires who had died since the
beginning of Parliament, for the names are those of living men.
Against most of the constituencies two or three names are placed; Dr.
Gairdner suggests that these are the possible candidates suggested by
Cromwell and to be nominated by the King. But why is "the King's
pleasure" placed opposite only three vacancies, if the whole
twenty-eight were to be filled on his nomination? The names are
probably those of influential magnates in the neighbourhood who would
naturally have the chief voice in the election; and thus they would
correspond with the vacancies, <i>e.g.</i>, Hastings, opposite which is
placed "Not for the Warden of the Cinque Ports," and Southwark, for
which there is a similar note for the Duke of Suffolk. It is obvious
that the King could not fill up all the vacancies by nomination; for
opposite Worcester town, where <i>both</i> members, Dee and Brenning, had
died, is noted, "the King to name <i>one</i>". It is curious to find "the
King's pleasure" after Winchester city, as that was one of the
constituencies for which Gardiner as bishop afterwards said he was
wont to nominate burgesses (Foxe, ed. Townsend, vi., 54). It must also
be remembered that these were bye-elections and possibly a novelty. In
1536 the rebels demand that "if a knight or burgess died during
Parliament his room should continue void to the end of the same" (<i>L.
and P.</i>, xi., 1182 [17]). In the seventeenth century supplementary
members were chosen for the Long Parliament to fill possible
vacancies; there were no bye-elections.<a href="#footnotetag898">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 932:</b> A much neglected but very important constitutional
question is whether the King <i>quâ</i> Supreme Head of the Church was
limited by the same statute and common law restrictions as he was
<i>quâ</i> temporal sovereign. Gardiner raised the question in a most
interesting letter to Protector Somerset in 1547 (Foxe, vi., 42). It
had been provided, as Lord Chancellor Audley told Gardiner, that no
spiritual law and no exercise of the royal supremacy should abate the
common law or Acts of Parliament; but within the ecclesiastical sphere
there were no limits on the King's authority. The Popes had not been
fettered, <i>habent omnia jura in suo scrinio</i>; and their jurisdiction
in England had been transferred whole and entire to the King. Henry
was in fact an absolute monarch in the Church, a constitutional
monarch in the State; he could reform the Church by injunction when he
could not reform the State by proclamation. There was naturally a
tendency to confuse the two capacities not merely in the King's mind
but in his opponents'; and some of the objections to the Stuarts'
dispensing practice, which was exercised chiefly in the ecclesiastical
sphere, seem due to this confusion. Parliament in fact, as soon as the
Tudors were gone, began to apply common law and statute law
limitations to the Crown's ecclesiastical prerogative.<a href="#footnotetag932">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 934:</b> The general idea that Fisher and More were executed for
refusing to take an oath prescribed in the Act of Supremacy is
technically inaccurate. No oath is there prescribed, and not till 1536
was it made high treason to refuse to take the oath of supremacy; even
then the oath was to be administered only to civil and ecclesiastical
officers. The Act under which they were executed was 26 Henry VIII.,
c. 13, and the common mistake arises from a confusion between the oath
to the succession and the oath of supremacy.<a href="#footnotetag934">(back)</a></p>

Emperor should make use of Reginald Pole "to whom, according to many,
the kingdom would belong" (Chapuys to Charles, 27th September, 1533).
Again, says Chapuys, "the holy Bishop of Rochester would like you to
take active measures immediately, as I wrote in my last; which advice
he has sent to me again lately to repeat" (10th October, 1533). Canon
Whitney, in criticising Froude (<i>Engl. Hist. Rev.</i>, xii., 353),

<b>Footnote 962:</b> <i>Ibid.</i>, vi., 1054, 1069. As early as April, 1531,
Chapuys reports that Anne "was becoming more arrogant every day, using
words and authority towards the King of which he has several times
complained to the Duke of Norfolk, saying that she was not like the
Queen [Catherine] who never in her life used ill words to him"
(<i>ibid.</i>, v., 216). In Sept., 1534, Henry was reported to be in love
with another lady (<i>ibid.</i>, vii., 1193, 1257). Probably this was Jane
Seymour, as the lady's kindness to the Princess Mary&mdash;a marked
characteristic of Queen Jane&mdash;is noted by Chapuys. This intrigue,
we are told, was furthered by many lords with the object of separating
the King from Anne Boleyn, who was disliked by the lords on account of
her pride and that of her kinsmen and brothers (<i>ibid.</i>, vii., 1279).
Henry's behaviour to the Princess was becoming quite benevolent, and
Chapuys begins to speak of his "amiable and cordial nature" (<i>ibid.</i>,
vii., 1297).<a href="#footnotetag962">(back)</a></p>

Emperor's subjects, he sent for the executioner of St. Omer, as there
were none in England good enough" (<i>ibid.</i>, x., 965). It is perhaps
well to be reminded that even at this date there were more practised
executioners in the Netherlands than in England.<a href="#footnotetag964">(back)</a></p>

Chapuys ascribes to Anne, was an Anabaptist doctrine of the time.

<b>Footnote 975:</b> Parliament prefered to risk the results of Henry's
nomination to the risk of civil war, which would inevitably have
broken out had Henry died in 1536. Hobbes, it may be noted, made this
power of nomination an indispensable attribute of the sovereign, and
if the sovereign be interpreted as the "King in Parliament" the theory
is sound constitutionalism and was put in practice in 1701 as well as
in 1536. But the limitations on Henry's power of bequeathing the crown
have generally been forgotten; he never had power to leave the crown
away from Edward VI., that is, away from the only heir whose
legitimacy was undisputed. The later acts went further, and entailed
the succession upon Mary and Elizabeth unless Henry wished
otherwise&mdash;which he did not. The preference of the Suffolk to the
Stuart line may have been due to (1) the common law forbidding aliens
to inherit English land (<i>cf. L. and P.</i>, vii., 337); (2) the national
dislike of the Scots; (3) a desire to intimate to the Scots that if
they would not unite the two realms by the marriage of Edward and
Mary, they should not obtain the English crown by inheritance.<a href="#footnotetag975">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 1012:</b> This was part of the revived influence of the Roman
Civil Law in England which Professor Maitland has sketched in his
<i>English Law and the Renaissance</i>, 1901. But the influence of these
ideas extended into every sphere, and not least of all into the
ecclesiastical. Englishmen, said Chapuys, were fond of tracing the
King's imperial authority back to a grant from the Emperor
Constantine&mdash;giving it thus an antiquity as great and an origin
as authoritative as that claimed for the Pope by the false <i>Donation
of Constantine</i> (<i>L. and P.</i>, v., 45; vii., 232). This is the meaning
of Henry's assertion that the Pope's authority in England was
"usurped," not that it was usurped at the expense of the English
national Church, but at the expense of his prerogative. So, too, we
find instructive complaints from a different sort of reformers that
the reformation as effected by Henry VIII. was merely a <i>translatio
imperii</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, XIV., ii., 141). Henry VIII.'s encouragement of the
civil law was the natural counterpart of the prohibition of its study
by Pope Honorius in 1219 and Innocent IV. in 1254 (Pollock and
Maitland, i., 102, 103).<a href="#footnotetag1012">(back)</a></p>

compromise between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, which bears
some resemblance to the ecclesiastical policy pursued by Henry VIII.,
and by the Elector Joachim II. of Brandenburg; and the marriage of
Anne with Henry did not imply so great a change in ecclesiastical
policy as has usually been supposed. The objections to it were really
more political than religious; the Schmalkaldic League was a feeble

Jane Seymour, and Henry's taste in the matter of feminine beauty was
not of a very high order. Bishop Stubbs even suggests that their

merits, and upon that discussion formed his own opinion (Cranmer to
Wolfgang Capito, <i>Works</i>, ii., 341; the King, says Cranmer, "is a most
acute and vigilant observer"). Henry was also, according to modern
standards, extraordinarily patient of theological discourses; when
Cranmer obtained for Latimer an appointment to preach at Court, he
advised him not to preach more than an hour or an hour and a half lest
the King and Queen should grow weary! (<i>L. and P.</i>, vii.,

<b>Footnote 1081:</b> In 1536 Henry had sent round a circular to the
sheriffs; but its main object was to show that another Parliament was
indispensable, to persuade the people that "their charge and time,
which will be very little and short, would be well spent," and to
secure "that persons are elected who will serve, and for their worship
and qualities be most meet for this purpose" (<i>L. and P.</i>, x., 815).
The sheriffs in fact were simply to see that the burden was placed on
those able and willing to bear it. The best illustration of the
methods adopted and of the amount of liberty of election exercised by
the constituents may be found in Southampton's letter to Cromwell
(<i>ibid.</i>, XIV., i., 520). At Guildford he told the burgesses they must
return two members, which would be a great charge to the town, "but
that if they followed my advice it would cost little or nothing, for I
would provide able men to supply the room". They said that one Daniel
Modge wanted one of the seats, but Southampton might arrange for the
other. About the Sussex election he was doubtful, but various friends
had promised to do their parts. Farnham, he said, returned burgesses
(though it does not appear in the <i>Official Return</i>), but that was the
bishop's town, "and my Lord Chamberlain is his steward there; so I
forbear to meddle".<a href="#footnotetag1081">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 1112:</b> Henry soon recognised this himself, and a year after
the Act was passed he ordered that "no further persecution should take
place for religion, and that those in prison should be set at liberty
on finding security for their appearance when called for" (<i>L. and
P.</i>, xvi., 271). Cranmer himself wrote that "within a year or a little
more" Henry "was fain to temper his said laws, and moderate them in
divers points; so that the Statute of Six Articles continued in force
little above the space of one year" (<i>Works</i>, ii., 168). The idea that
from 1539 to 1547 there was a continuous and rigorous persecution is a
legend derived from Foxe; there were outbursts of rigour in 1540,
1543, and 1546, but except for these the Six Articles remained almost
a dead letter (see <i>L. and P.</i>, XVIII., i., Introd., p. xlix.; pt.

<b>Footnote 1126:</b> This had been asserted by Henry as early as 1524;
Scotland was only to be included in the peace negotiations of that
year as "a fief of the King of England"; it was to be recognised that

James and government of the kingdom during his minority (<i>Sp. Cal.</i>,

<b>Footnote 1156:</b> This is the usual view, but it is a somewhat doubtful
inference. Henry's one object was the maintenance of order and his own
power; he would never have set himself against the nation as a whole,
and there are indications that at the end of his reign he was
preparing to accept the necessity of further changes. The fall of the
Howards was due to the fear that they would cause trouble in the
coming minority of Edward VI. Few details are known of the party
struggle in the Council in the autumn of 1546, and they come from
Selve's <i>Correspondance</i> and the new volume (1904) of the <i>Spanish

Cromwell and Somerset had more cause to complain of their fate than
other statesmen of the time, yet Cromwell on the scaffold says: "I am
by the law condemned to die, and thank my Lord God that hath appointed
me this death for mine offence.... I have offended my prince, for the
which I ask him heartily forgiveness" (Foxe, v., 402). And Somerset
says: "I am condemned by a law whereunto I am subject, as we all; and
therefore to show obedience I am content to die" (Ellis, <i>Orig.
Letters</i>, II., ii., 215; <i>England under Somerset</i>, p. 308). Compare
Buckingham in Shakespeare, "<i>Henry VIII.</i>," Act II., Sc. i.:&mdash;

relieve the Crown of the hostility aroused by curbing the power of the
nobles (<i>Il Principe</i> c. 19). A closer parallel to the policy of Henry
VIII. may be found in that which Tacitus attributes to Tiberius with
regard to the Senate; "he must devolve on the Senate the odious duty
of trial and condemnation and reserve only the credit of clemency for
himself" (Furneaux, <i>Tacitus</i>,
